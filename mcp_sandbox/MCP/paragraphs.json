  "For malignant pericardial effusion, urgent pericardiocentesis is indicated in tamponade, while pericardiotomy reduces effusion recurrence compared with pericardiocentesis and may be offered to stable patients with sufficient life expectancy and good performance status.",
  "For malignant pericardial effusion, acute care involves pericardiocentesis for tamponade (and drainage for large suspected malignant effusions), while definitive management requires systemic antineoplastic therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery), with guidelines also recommending extended pericardial drainage.",
  "For malignant pericardial effusion causing symptomatic tamponade, the paper recommends pericardiocentesis and subsequent systemic chemotherapy to control the underlying malignancy; radiation therapy is no longer favored for this indication.",
  "Malignant pericardial effusion is diagnosed by cytology from pericardiocentesis; management options include pericardiocentesis for initial symptomatic relief, percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy for recurrent effusions, and evidence suggests systemic chemotherapy combined with a pericardial window can be more effective than chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus drainage.",
  "For malignant pericardial effusion, the ESC guidelines recommend systemic antineoplastic therapy once neoplastic etiology is confirmed; extended pericardial drainage is also recommended to prevent recurrence and allow intrapericardial therapy, while radiotherapy is considered specifically for radiosensitive malignancies such as lymphomas and leukaemias.",
  "For malignant pericardial effusion, the paper proposes a stepwise approach: start with pericardiocentesis (with or without an indwelling catheter), proceed to chemical pericardial symphysis using a sclerosing agent, and reserve a subxiphoid pericardial window for recurrent cases; surgical windows provide only short-term palliation and do not improve long-term survival.",
  "For malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade, acute management consists of pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage; pericardiocentesis is the standard acute approach but has higher recurrence, whereas a surgical pericardial window is effective for recurrent effusions at the expense of more bleeding/infection risk.",
  "Pericardiocentesis has high recurrence for large pericardial effusions, whereas a surgical pericardial window provides definitive continuous drainage; indications for window surgery include symptomatic or hypotensive moderate-to-large effusions and suspected metastatic cancer, and thoracotomy windows may better prevent recurrence than subxiphoid windows.",
  "In metastatic melanoma with cardiac involvement, reported treatments included immunotherapy (65%), targeted therapy (35%), radiotherapy (25%), and surgery (15%); pericardial effusion was a recognized cardiovascular complication (17%), and systemic and/or surgical interventions can alleviate symptoms and reduce cardiovascular impact.",
  "Quiescent adult neural stem cell activation is tightly linked to metabolic state: they rely on glycolysis/PPP while quiescent, and interventions that alter metabolism—such as inhibiting fatty acid oxidation (via malonyl-CoA) or blocking the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier—can trigger activation and increase neurogenesis, including in aged mice.",
  "Flow cytometric analysis using Ki-67 as a proliferation marker, in combination with DNA content, enables clear discrimination of quiescent (G0) cells from actively cycling cells and allows quantification of cell cycle phase distribution; Ki-67 is absent in G0 and elevated during G1/S/G2/M, peaking in G2/early M.",
  "Adult neural stem/progenitor cells depend on Fasn-mediated de novo lipogenesis for proliferation; inhibition or conditional deletion of Fasn reduces proliferation/neurogenesis, while Spot14—enriched in low-proliferating NSPCs—lowers malonyl-CoA and lipid synthesis, thereby acting as a brake on NSPC proliferation.",
  "This study demonstrates that a lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 library (GeCKO) using a single-vector lentiCRISPR system can efficiently knock out genes and enable both positive and negative selection genome-scale screens in human cells.",
  "GLUT4 is an insulin-sensitive glucose transporter predominantly expressed in neurons (including in the olfactory bulb) where it often coexists with GLUT3; during sustained neuronal activation, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) promotes insertion of Glut4 into axonal membranes to support the increased metabolic energy demand.",
  "In mice, three months of intermittent fasting increased hippocampal neurogenesis markers (NeuN, Nestin, PSD95) and activated pro-neurogenic signaling (Notch 1, NICD1, HES5), supporting a link between metabolic intervention and enhanced adult neurogenesis.",
  "Quiescent adult neural stem/progenitor cells exhibit high CPT1a-dependent fatty acid oxidation, and elevating malonyl-CoA is sufficient to override quiescence cues and drive cell-cycle re-entry and proliferation.",
  "In the adult brain, GLUT4 is present in hippocampal neurons and undergoes insulin-receptor–dependent translocation to the plasma membrane; experimental data show that hippocampal GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake is required for memory acquisition, indicating activity-dependent regulation of neuronal glucose handling via GLUT4.",
  "The paper establishes that reliable CRISPR screening depends on both sgRNA efficacy and specificity; it introduces STARS for hit ranking based on multiple sgRNAs per gene and the CFD score to quantify off-target risk, showing that off-target-prone sgRNAs can cause erroneous depletion in negative selection screens and that optimized design improves hit-list accuracy.",
  "Ki-67 is a validated proliferation marker: it is highly expressed in cycling cells, absent in resting G0 cells, and its expression is cell cycle–regulated with MKI67 promoter activity and Ki-67 mRNA increasing during G1.",
  "The paper details a next-generation sequencing approach using barcoded amplicons to screen CRISPR-Cas9 edits across up to 96 clones in parallel, enabling identification of indels near target sites and distinguishing homozygous, heterozygous, and mixed clones, with a high observed mutation incidence (65/67 clones).",
  "MAGeCK applies median normalization, negative binomial modeling, and a modified robust rank aggregation (α-RRA) to rank sgRNAs and genes, enabling simultaneous detection of positively and negatively selected genes from pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screens and demonstrating robustness across different experimental conditions.",
  "This paper establishes that pooled, lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screens in mammalian cells can be conducted under positive and negative selection by integrating sgRNA cassettes as barcodes and tracking them via high-throughput sequencing; single-copy sgRNA integration is sufficient to induce efficient gene-disrupting mutations that yield loss-of-function alleles.",
  "CRISPR validation assays differ in reliability: T7E1 often underestimates editing and plateaus at ~30–40% due to limited dynamic range, while targeted NGS provides a broader, more accurate measure; TIDE and IDAA generally agree with NGS for edited pools but tend to underestimate frequencies and can miscall indels, especially in clones.",
  "TIDE quantifies CRISPR-induced indel frequencies and spectra from mixed cell populations by decomposing Sanger sequencing traces of PCR amplicons; it requires only two PCRs and two capillary runs, delivers results in 1–2 days, and detects indels at approximately 1–2% sensitivity.",
  "In the subventricular zone, calorie restriction does not increase proliferation in aged mice but preserves neurogenesis, maintaining olfactory bulb new neuron production at levels comparable to young mice while aged ad libitum-fed controls show significant declines.",
  "In the hippocampus, insulin-responsive GLUT4 supports on-demand neuronal glucose supply and is downregulated at the membrane under insulin-resistant conditions (e.g., high-fat diet), while aging may further limit central insulin signaling via reduced blood–brain barrier insulin transport.",
  "CRISPR-Cas9 pooled knockout screens induce loss of function via indel-mediated frameshifts and are well-suited to in vivo applications and FACS-selectable proliferation phenotypes; top hits typically show strong consistency across multiple sgRNAs in positive selection settings.",
  "Caloric restriction enhances NSC proliferation in adult rodent dentate gyrus and SVZ, while aging shifts NSC metabolism toward glycolysis with reduced mitochondrial function that correlates with reduced proliferation; moreover, metabolic stress via 2-deoxyglucose activates SIRT1 and suppresses NSC proliferation.",
  "In Hfr conjugation the chromosome enters from the Origin with F last and because average transfer is only about 16 percent of donor DNA per mating early markers are delivered more frequently than late markers",
  "During bacterial conjugation, chromosomal transfer proceeds in an ordered, progressive fashion; the chromosomal site associated with F tends to be transferred last, and F (including F') enables the donation of chromosomal markers to recipient cells.",
  "In E. coli Hfr × F- matings, the donor chromosome enters the recipient cell uni-directionally; interruptions of transfer yield only chromosome fragments, which then recombine with the F- chromosome—often incorporating linked markers together in a single event.",
  "Interrupted-mating (Hfr × F−) mapping in E. coli relies on the near-constant-speed, oriented injection of the donor chromosome; by periodically interrupting conjugation and recording the time when each donor marker first appears in recipients, researchers infer gene order and estimate map distances from the time intervals between successive markers.",
  "In E. coli interrupted mating with Hfr donors, early-entering markers form high-frequency recombinant classes, with early recombinants reaching up to about 50% of the input donor cells.",
  "Nalidixic acid enables a simplified interrupted-mating protocol by instantly stopping Hfr DNA transfer and allowing selection of recombinants on plates, so researchers can sample over time and enumerate recombinants to determine gene order by time of entry.",
  "Crossover frequency during conjugation is not uniform; it is greatly elevated in the region immediately adjacent to the leading end of transferred DNA, most pronounced within about 1 minute of the origin (e.g., 72.5% between a proximal marker and the origin vs. 2.8–9% in more distal regions), with detectable effects extending up to approximately 3 minutes from the origin.",
  "Organic radicals offer a spin-allowed SUMO→SOMO emission pathway with a theoretical 100% internal quantum efficiency for OLEDs, but they are generally disfavored in OLED applications due to intrinsic instability of the unpaired electron, which drives side reactions such as dimerization, recombination, and electron transfer unless effective stabilization (e.g., steric protection) is employed.",
  "The paper highlights intrinsic drawbacks of radical emitters: EISC-driven fluorescence quenching and the frequent non-emissive character of stable radicals caused by large energy gaps that block RISC from dark to emissive states; in the studied system, the primary doublet (D1) also shows a very slow radiative rate, necessitating population transfer to brighter doublet states to achieve effective emission.",
  "Broad emission in OLED emitters arises from vibronic coupling that is amplified by delocalized excited-state electron density; this broadening often necessitates filters or microcavities to improve color purity, which in turn significantly reduces EQE and increases power consumption, whereas multi-resonance designs minimize vibronic coupling and narrow the emission.",
  "Polychlorinated trityl radicals are intrinsically weak emitters due to low oscillator strength and long radiative lifetimes that favor internal conversion, and in condensed solid-state they undergo aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) that reduces fluorescence quantum yield, with stronger quenching at higher radical concentrations.",
  "For luminescent organic neutral radicals used as NIR emitters, red-shifting the emission commonly incurs a strong drop in PLQY due to enhanced non-radiative decay (energy gap law), as exemplified by PTM-TPA radicals where shifting 763→885 nm reduced PLQY from 0.38 to 0.04.",
  "In alternant-symmetry trityl radicals, the lowest-energy doublet transition (D0−D1) possesses vanishing oscillator strength, rendering these materials historically ‘dark’ with PLQEs only of a few percent; this poor intrinsic luminescence has limited practical radical designs unless symmetry is broken or charge-transfer character is introduced.",
  "For pure-green multi-resonance emitter OLEDs, efficiency rolloff and device stability are key challenges; rolloff is common in MRE-only devices and increases when more triplets form directly on the MRE, while hyperfluorescent architectures that route excitons through a faster TADF assistant dopant can suppress rolloff.",
  "The paper identifies that achieving high color purity in OLEDs is hindered by the inherently broad emission spectra and long-wavelength vibrational features of organic emitters; while microcavity structures can suppress these features to improve purity, they can simultaneously introduce angular color distortions that must be managed through device design.",
  "The paper states that while radical emitters can theoretically reach 100% internal quantum efficiency, their practical application is limited by generally low photoluminescence quantum yields (often <5%, e.g., TTM ~3%) and mediocre photostability; degradation mechanisms include single-photon-induced hydrogen abstraction from solvents and cyclization of chlorinated phenyl rings that require planarization.",
  "Native chemical ligation assembles proteins from SPPS-derived peptide fragments (typically split into ~50-residue pieces); with Fmoc-SPPS, thioester surrogates are prepared and converted in situ to aryl thioesters for ligation at an N-terminal cysteine under near-neutral aqueous conditions.",
  "Because solid-phase peptide synthesis is typically limited to about 40 residues, construction of ~100-residue proteins with site-specific nonnatural functionality is achieved by convergent peptide ligation (e.g., native chemical ligation) or by semisynthesis via expressed protein ligation that joins a recombinant fragment to a chemically synthesized segment.",
  "The paper describes a solid-phase N-to-C sequential native chemical ligation approach that uses an N3-Esoc N-terminal linker and a SEAon/SEAoﬀ thioester surrogate to concatenate unprotected peptide segments on resin, demonstrated by assembling peptides of 94 and 136 amino acids and isolating a 60-amino-acid latent thioester segment.",
  "The document describes SEA native peptide ligation conditions (MPAA and TCEP in 0.1 M phosphate buffer near neutral pH, 37°C) to join peptide segments prepared by standard Fmoc solid-phase synthesis, yielding purified ligation products such as peptide 10 in 54%.",
  "Native chemical ligation enables assembly of proteins in the ~100–150 aa range by chemoselective ligation at X–Cys junctions (C-terminal thioester to N-terminal cysteine), is compatible with all 20 natural amino acids at the X position (with Val, Ile, and Pro slower), and leverages chemical protein synthesis to incorporate unnatural amino acids.",
  "In cystic fibrosis airway infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly becomes mucoid via mutations in mucA, and hypermutable strains—characterized by markedly elevated mutation rates—are reported to be more likely to exhibit the mucoid phenotype.",
  "Mucoid conversion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly arises via inactivation of mucA, with multiple distinct mutation types (e.g., frameshifts and nonsense changes) documented in both laboratory derivatives and clinical CF isolates, and such mucA mutants are selected during chronic CF lung infection.",
  "During chronic CF airway infection, a late-arising mutS mismatch repair mutation indicative of a hypermutator phenotype was observed, and mucA mutations occurred independently across three lineages within the same patient, demonstrating both increased mutational processes and parallel evolution affecting mucA in chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.",
  "Among mucoid P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients, mucA is frequently mutated (84%), predominantly via truncating lesions (frameshifts or C-to-T nonsense), and distinct mucA alleles can co-occur within a single patient, indicating multiple independent mutation events and a diverse mutation spectrum.",
  "In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, mucoid conversion in cystic fibrosis isolates is most commonly linked to mutations in mucA—typically at the 3′ end that disrupt MucA–MucB interaction—and multiple environmental stresses (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, antimicrobial peptides, nutrient starvation, estradiol) can induce such mucA mutations; the frequent mucA22 frameshift arises from a mutable homopolymeric G tract.",
  "In mismatch repair-deficient (mutS) P. aeruginosa, mucA becomes the dominant route to mucoid conversion with a narrowed mutation spectrum dominated by 21 bp deletions in G:C SSRs (notably G5-SSR 426), and engineering a longer SSR (C6-SSR 431) further restricts mucA mutations to 100% 21 bp deletions within the SSR while increasing the frequency of mucoid variants.",
  "Mucoid conversion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa can arise via a proteolytic signaling pathway in which overexpressed MucE increases AlgU activity and reduces MucA levels, providing a mucA-mutation-independent route to alginate overproduction; mucA mutations are reported in 44–84% of mucoid isolates, indicating additional non-mucA mechanisms such as the MucE–AlgW/MucP pathway.",
  "In longitudinal CF Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, mutations in mucA and lasR appeared before mutations in anti-mutator genes, indicating hypermutability was not required for mucoidy; specific mucA changes observed included C349T and DG430, while mutator genotypes arose later and varied across patients.",
  "During chronic cystic fibrosis airway infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes adaptive changes that can include conversion to mucoidy, and loss-of-function lasR mutants frequently arise and may dominate or coexist within mixed bacterial populations in patients.",
  "In cystic fibrosis chronic respiratory infection hypermutator Pseudomonas aeruginosa lineages emerge and rapidly accumulate mutations and this accelerated adaptation extends beyond antimicrobial resistance to include phenotypic variants such as lasR and mucA mutants.",
  "In MMR-deficient hypermutator Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucoid conversion increases and frequently arises via mucA simple sequence repeat indels at homopolymers such as the G5-SSR426 deletion that yields the mucA22 allele",
  "Mucoid conversion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa can occur without mucA mutations through AlgW-dependent proteolysis of MucA, and loss-of-function in kinB drives alginate overproduction in a wild-type mucA background by increasing AlgU pathway activity.",
  "In spontaneously breathing patients on room air, SpO 2 > 97% is considered normal; pulse oximetry cannot detect hyperoxemia/hyperoxia, and excessive oxygen can decrease cardiac output, reduce regional blood flow, and increase oxidative stress; additionally, supplemental oxygen may mask detection of hypoventilation.",
  "The review states that when rapid and complete removal of necrotic tissue is required—such as in infected wounds with systemic sepsis or necrotizing fasciitis—surgical/sharp debridement is the only method capable of fully debriding the wound in a single encounter, whereas enzymatic debridement should not be used if necrosis is advancing.",
  "For adults with critical illness such as shock, the BTS guideline recommends initiating high-concentration oxygen via a reservoir mask at 15 L/min to target SpO2 94–98%, while emphasizing that oxygen treats hypoxaemia only (not the underlying cause, which requires urgent management), and noting that in severe anaemia the primary treatment is correction of anaemia because most anaemic patients do not require oxygen.",
  "Oxygen delivery to tissues depends on arterial oxygen content (CaO2) and cardiac output; CaO2 comprises hemoglobin-bound and dissolved oxygen, classically calculated as CaO2 = 1.39 × Hb × SaO2 + 0.0031 × PaO2, with a proposed temperature-corrected coefficient of 1.58 for the hemoglobin-bound term at 37 °C.",
  "Severe dehydration (>10% volume loss) is managed as a medical emergency with rapid IV isotonic saline at 20 ml/kg, and ORS is contraindicated when volume loss exceeds 10%, in shock, inability to drink, persistent vomiting preventing retention, or ileus.",
  "In anemia, SpO2 can remain normal despite reduced oxygen content, and in low-perfusion states (e.g., hypotension/shock) SpO2 may be inaccurate; therefore, pulse oximetry should be interpreted with caution in these contexts and used to monitor response to circulatory interventions (e.g., fluid resuscitation or vasopressors) rather than to assess oxygen status alone.",
  "For necrotizing soft tissue infections, early aggressive surgical debridement, prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotics, and early, aggressive supportive care—specifically including fluid resuscitation—are central to management.",
  "In critical illness, microcirculatory failure is influenced by venous back pressure (causing flow stagnation), requires maintaining MAP ≥60 mmHg to avoid widespread disruption, and can be exacerbated by excessive intravenous fluids that degrade the endothelial glycocalyx; restrictive fluid strategies have been shown to be safe and non-inferior.",
  "The guidelines emphasize that wound healing depends on adequate oxygenation and perfusion (which are impaired by dehydration), require debridement of necrotic tissue with surgical (sharp) debridement indicated for rapid removal of large amounts of necrosis, and reserve systemic antibiotic therapy for cases with systemic sepsis, spreading cellulitis, or underlying osteomyelitis.",
  "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is presented as an accepted adjunct for severe anaemia when transfusion is not possible, working by markedly increasing dissolved plasma oxygen (e.g., PaO2 >1600 mm Hg under hyperbaric 100% oxygen) to alleviate oxygen debt irrespective of the anaemia’s underlying cause.",
  "In normobaric critical care settings, prolonged exposure to high fractions of inspired oxygen has established, time- and concentration-dependent pulmonary toxicity; thus, the paper emphasizes ensuring adequate oxygen delivery while limiting FiO2 rather than targeting supranormal PaO2/SpO2.",
  "In critically ill patients, changes in pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) correlate only moderately with arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and tend to overestimate SaO2 changes; anaemia and acidosis have only minor, clinically unimportant effects on this relationship, and prior ICU practice has used minimum SpO2 levels of about 92–96% to maintain SaO2 at 90%.",
  "In this trauma case managed without transfusion, clinicians started intravenous crystalloid resuscitation but, because crystalloids do not restore oxygen-carrying capacity, also administered intravenous vasopressor support (norepinephrine) to maintain circulation and organ perfusion.",
  "In severe sepsis with hypoperfusion, early intravascular volume expansion (typically via rapid crystalloid or colloid infusion) is central to hemodynamic management, but because volume expansion can cause edema and may not always improve hemodynamics, clinicians should assess fluid responsiveness (e.g., using passive leg raising with hemodynamic measurements) to guide fluid administration.",
  "In sepsis, endothelial glycocalyx injury drives capillary leak and relative hypovolemia; while fluid boluses are core to initial management, crystalloids can worsen transcapillary leakage and edema, and evidence suggests albumin/colloid strategies or maintaining plasma proteins may better preserve intravascular volume and glycocalyx integrity, whereas higher IV fluid volumes correlate with greater glycocalyx degradation and worse outcomes.",
  "Anaemia can reduce arterial oxygen content and tissue oxygen delivery without lowering oxygen saturation, and when saturation already exceeds 90%, further increases in PaO2 add little to oxygen content and may even diminish tissue oxygen delivery; thus typical adult targets are 94–98% saturation.",
  "In sepsis, intravenous fluid resuscitation can worsen endothelial glycocalyx injury and promote edema that impairs oxygen diffusion, with fluid overload linked to adverse outcomes, and there are currently no established pharmacologic therapies that directly attenuate vascular leakage.",
  "In adult NSTI, standard care comprises intravenous empiric antibiotics, early surgical debridement initiated alongside intensive care support (including fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation), and delayed surgery is linked to increased mortality; adjunctive therapies such as IVIG and hyperbaric oxygen lack supportive trial evidence and are not recommended in guidelines cited by the review.",
  "Fluids are typically first-line in circulatory failure, but because boluses only raise cardiac output in about half of untested cases and fluid overload is harmful, the paper recommends dynamically assessing preload responsiveness to guide fluid therapy; however, in obvious hypovolemia—such as the initial phase of septic shock before any volume expansion—urgent fluid administration should not be delayed for testing.",
  "The study shows that in 9-(X-methyl)fluorenes, substrates with better leaving groups (Br, Cl) undergo elimination via an E2 pathway rather than ElcB, with definitive evidence for bromides and a leaving group reactivity sequence Br > Cl > OH.",
  "The paper models β-eliminations on a shared potential-energy surface and predicts that increasing base strength stabilizes both product and carbanion, yielding an E2 transition state with reduced C–X bond breaking and ambiguous change in C–H bond breaking, while greater carbanion stability makes the E2 transition state more carbanion-like.",
  "Mechanistic preference in SN2/E2 competition depends on base basicity: stronger Lewis bases (higher proton affinity) can favor E2 by overcoming greater distortion through stronger acid–base-like interactions, exemplified by F− favoring E2 while PH2− favors SN2 with chloroethane.",
  "For cyclohexyl substrates, stronger bases (e.g., ButO- in ButOH) drive eliminations toward E2H-like transition states where proton basicity is the key determinant; cyclohexyl bromide behaves as a tighter substrate that undergoes efficient elimination only with strong bases, while weak neutral bases predominantly substitute.",
  "In cyclohexane systems, bimolecular (E2) eliminations follow an anti-elimination rule that imposes conformational constraints; for menthyl chloride, access to the necessary anti geometry requires an unstable axial conformation and permits elimination in only one direction (giving exclusively menth-2-ene), whereas for neomenthyl chloride the accessible reactive conformation allows anti alignment in either direction, with product distribution then governed by electromeric effects.",
  "In eliminations of 2-butyl halides, increasing the steric bulk of the alkoxide base (from potassium t-butoxide to potassium t-heptoxide) increases formation of the less substituted (Hofmann) alkene, and this trend persists in a common solvent like toluene, indicating the direction of E2 elimination is primarily governed by base steric effects rather than solvent polarity.",
  "The study shows that phenethyl bromides undergo NaOH-catalysed 1,2-elimination of HBr via an E2 mechanism across Me2SO–H2O mixtures, with rates monitored by formation of the corresponding styrene; related E2 behavior for X = Br is also discussed in the KOBut–ButOH system.",
  "Gas-phase pyrolysis of menthyl and neomenthyl chlorides proceeds via a stereospecific cis-elimination pathway, with product distributions (menth-3-ene from menthyl chloride and menth-2-ene from neomenthyl chloride) controlled by the availability of a hydrogen cis to chlorine.",
  "B-cell antigen recognition and activation are optimized in secondary lymphoid follicles where follicular dendritic cells concentrate and display antigen; co-receptors (CD21/CD19/CD81/CD225) can amplify BCR signaling up to 1000-fold and lower the antigen threshold for activation, while BCR specificity derives from V(D)J recombination of heavy and light chain variable regions.",
  "In this single-cell workflow, plasmablasts sorted into 96-well RT plates yielded 9 paired heavy/light-chain sequences from 24 wells, and functional monoclonal antibodies could be produced within approximately six working days using linear expression cassettes, demonstrating the efficiency and speed of the approach.",
  "The paper demonstrates that image-based cell sorting can isolate cell-cell interaction events (e.g., platelet aggregates), but accurate identification benefits from deep-learning image analysis because classical feature-based methods show substantial overlap between aggregates and other cell types.",
  "In single mammalian cells total mRNA count and global transcription rate scale linearly with cell volume; consequently larger cells contain proportionally more RNA molecules than smaller cells due to increased transcription.",
  "RT-qPCR performance is highly context-dependent: raising RT primer concentration and adding suitable background RNA can improve cDNA yield, yet measured RT efficiency still varied broadly (about 19–91%) with target concentration and conditions, underscoring that the RT step can substantially limit overall assay efficiency.",
  "Nested PCR-based recovery of paired Ig heavy- and light-chain sequences from single B cells has an intrinsic 40%–60% amplification efficiency, and success can be further reduced if primer sets are not tailored to the specific strain/species, isotype, leader sequence, and V-gene families—factors that can lead to few or no bands despite proper controls.",
  "Internal oligo(dT) priming onto genome-encoded A-rich sequences (A-SNRs) can initiate cDNA synthesis at internal sites, yielding truncated cDNAs and sometimes occurring more frequently than priming at true poly(A) tails; although anchored oligo(dT) primers mitigate this effect, they do not eliminate it, and signs of internal priming are widespread across both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets.",
  "In single-cell RT-qPCR, reverse transcription is the primary bottleneck and often the least reliable step; using highly efficient RTases (Maxima H- or SuperScript IV) is recommended, and detection of very low-abundance transcripts is limited by a practical LoD of roughly 3–10 molecules, contributing to stochastic dropouts.",
  "CTCs in patient blood are extremely rare (≈1 per 10^9 white blood cells), often similar in size to leukocytes and smaller than cultured tumor cell lines, and analyses routinely detect not only single cells but also doublets and clusters—factors that make sensitive, specific isolation and downstream analyses technically challenging.",
  "In tumor cells, elevated c-Myc drives transcriptional amplification that increases total RNA per cell—including rRNA and tRNA—and broadly elevates mRNA transcript levels, resulting in a global rise in cellular RNA output.",
  "Reverse transcription can preferentially represent abundant RNAs—due to RTase sensitivity and random-hexamer primer consumption by abundant transcripts—and RTase choice itself (varying in sensitivity and yield) further influences recovery of low-abundance targets.",
  "In plate-based single-cell antibody sequencing, typical paired heavy–light chain recovery can be ~28–32%, with many wells failing due to issues such as absent or mis-sorted cells (including cells missing the well), RNA degradation during processing (e.g., delays between sorting and freezing), or insufficient PCR cycles; overall, these workflows are highly sensitive to cell quality and require intact heavy and light chain transcripts.",
  "An image-activated cell sorting approach integrates microscopy, microfluidics, and deep-learning analysis to classify and sort cells in real time, and has been demonstrated to sort cells based on subcellular protein localization and intercellular interactions.",
  "ICS reconstructs multicolor fluorescence images of cells in flow and integrates image-derived features into the sorting electronics—treated like conventional parameters—to enable real-time visualization and high-speed sorting (up to 15,000 events per second) based on spatial phenotypes.",
  "In single-cell B cell workflows, sorting explicitly excludes doublets; cDNA is generated with random hexamers that reverse transcribe all expressed genes, and despite >95% beta-actin RT controls, recovery of paired Ig heavy and light chains typically succeeds in only 30–60% of wells.",
  "In RT-qPCR, the reverse transcription step is the principal source of variability, with efficiency strongly influenced by primer strategy, gene targets, and total RNA concentration; low RNA inputs can reduce yields unless carrier nucleic acids are added, and higher RT annealing temperatures or thermostable reverse transcriptases can improve yields by mitigating secondary structure and low-specificity priming.",
  "The paper provides explicit reverse-transcription and PCR primer sequences (including a template-switch oligo and sets of primers labeled sOMR/sOMNM for different targets) used to amplify immunoglobulin chains from cells sorted by flow cytometry, enabling recovery of antibody heavy and light chain sequences.",
  "Patau syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 13 (trisomy 13) and presents with midline craniofacial anomalies including cleft lip/palate, microcephaly, micrognathia, small malformed ears, and is associated with severe psychomotor impairment, failure to thrive, and intellectual disability in survivors.",
  "Seckel syndrome presents with severe microcephaly, growth delay, micrognathia, ear anomalies, and dental crowding; a Seckel syndrome locus has been mapped to chromosome 3q22.1–q24, and ATR/ATRIP mutations define a subtype with these clinical features.",
  "Chromosome 22q11.2 duplication syndrome (22q11.2DupS) arises via non-allelic homologous recombination and is associated with variable clinical presentations including congenital anomalies and developmental delay; among 235 individuals, 25% had congenital heart disease, predominantly involving cardiac outflow tract defects.",
  "Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 and is associated with intellectual impairment and characteristic craniofacial and skeletal features, including retrusion of the midface and mandible and the presence of fifth finger clinodactyly.",
  "Seckel syndrome (SCKL2) and Jawad syndrome are linked to chromosome 18p, with SCKL2 mapped to 18p11.31–q11.2 and Jawad to 18p11.22–q11.2, and CtIP (RBBP8) located within the SCKL2 locus.",
  "Seckel syndrome, characterized by severe prenatal growth retardation, proportionate short stature, severe microcephaly, and distinctive craniofacial features with mental retardation, was mapped by autozygosity to chromosome 3q22.1–q24 in two consanguineous families, with linkage between markers D3S1316 and D3S3710.",
  "Seckel syndrome shows genetic heterogeneity with three mapped loci: SCKL1 on chromosome 3q22.1–q24 (ATR), SCKL2 on 18p11.31–q11.2, and SCKL3 on 14q23; among these, SCKL3 is noted as the predominant locus.",
  "Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2del) is a multisystem condition associated with thymic hypoplasia and T-cell lymphopenia, and its common deletion breakpoints (often including the TBX1 region) are located on chromosome 22.",
  "Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) is defined by the presence of an extra chromosome 13 and is commonly recognized by a clinical triad of microphthalmia, polydactyly, and cleft palate; cleft lip/palate occurs in 60–70% of cases.",
  "Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion is the most common chromosomal deletion syndrome and underlies DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndromes, which commonly feature speech delay and craniofacial abnormalities due to disrupted development of pharyngeal arch-derived structures.",
  "Seckel syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by prenatal/postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, distinctive craniofacial features (e.g., beaked nose, midface hypoplasia, micrognathia), dental abnormalities, clinodactyly, and intellectual disability; a key genetic locus (SCKL1) maps to chromosome 3q22.1–q24.",
  "Seckel syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with characteristic microcephaly and bird-like facial features; associated orofacial findings can include dental caries and cleft palate, and a syndrome locus has been mapped to chromosome 3q22.1–q24.",
  "FRP1, a human PIK-related kinase gene homologous to checkpoint proteins, is localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosome 3q22–q24.",
  "For unit dose preparation and dispensing, the guidance requires pre-calculation and labeling of the actual dose at the time of injection with appropriate decay correction, verification of each unit dose using a dose calibrator, and confirms that 111In‑octreotide kits fall within the standard procedures described.",
  "The paper explains that time–activity curves are often modeled as sums of exponentials, and when extrapolating beyond the last measurement a conservative choice is to assume removal by physical decay; it also applies the relation T1/2 = 0.693/λ in an example (0.693/0.039 ≈ 17.8 h) to determine a half-time from a decay constant.",
  "For OctreoScan (111In-pentetreotide), the guideline recommends an adult administered activity of 222 MBq (6 mCi) and states the radiopharmaceutical should be used within 6 hours of preparation; the agent targets somatostatin receptors and can detect tumors including pheochromocytoma, with reported sensitivity over 85% for pheochromocytoma/neuroblastoma/paraganglioma.",
  "The manual emphasizes using the calibration (activity reference) time with the radioactive decay equation (A = A0 e−λt) to compute activities at times before or after calibration, illustrated by examples that adjust dose amounts via decay factors for pre-calibration time points.",
  "For small-scale, kit-based radiopharmaceutical preparations, syringes for individual patient doses must be labeled with the product name and radioactivity amount at a defined reference time, and the package insert’s kit labeling procedures must be strictly followed, with checks in place to detect any changes when new kit batches are received.",
  "For pregnant women with opioid use disorder, ASAM recommends buprenorphine monoproduct over the buprenorphine/naloxone combination, advises against naloxone use except in life-threatening overdose, and notes insufficient evidence to recommend the combination formulation, with further research needed to establish safety in pregnancy.",
  "In opioid-dependent adults induced onto sublingual soluble films, buprenorphine alone and buprenorphine/naloxone produced similar, significant reductions in opioid withdrawal (COWS) with no between-group differences and were considered safe and effective; naloxone is included to deter diversion/parenteral misuse and is not expected to precipitate withdrawal when taken sublingually as directed.",
  "The review explains that buprenorphine/naloxone is intended as an abuse-deterrent because naloxone is inactive sublingually but can precipitate withdrawal if injected or, in some cases, insufflated; nevertheless, deterrence is conditional and can be circumvented, observational data show lower weekly injection prevalence for buprenorphine/naloxone versus buprenorphine alone among OBOT patients, and crude death counts involving buprenorphine/naloxone should not be taken to mean it is less safe than buprenorphine alone due to much wider prescribing and incomplete causality assessments.",
  "In pregnancy, buprenorphine-naloxone taken sublingually results in minimal naloxone effect and shows no significant differences in neonatal birth parameters or congenital anomalies compared with buprenorphine monotherapy or other exposures; however, authors emphasize the need for larger prospective studies to confirm these findings.",
  "Naloxone in buprenorphine-naloxone generally has no clinical effect when taken sublingually as prescribed, but it precipitates severe withdrawal if injected (abuse deterrent); in hepatic impairment, manufacturers advise avoiding or using caution with the combination product due to altered naloxone exposure.",
  "In this randomized trial, emergency department–initiated buprenorphine/naloxone (a partial opioid agonist combined with an antagonist) was used both with observed dosing and via unobserved home induction; the intervention improved 30-day treatment engagement and reduced self-reported illicit opioid use compared with referral or brief intervention.",
  "In buprenorphine-maintained individuals, intravenous buprenorphine/naloxone showed lower abuse liability than buprenorphine alone; while sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone has similar safety and efficacy to buprenorphine alone, prior lab work shows naloxone can precipitate withdrawal when injected, though in this study no significant opioid withdrawal was detected by SOWS after buprenorphine/naloxone challenges.",
  "In pregnancy, ACOG notes that buprenorphine–naloxone deters injection by precipitating severe withdrawal if injected and does not cause withdrawal when used sublingually because naloxone is not orally active; while the monoproduct has historically been recommended to avoid potential prenatal naloxone exposure, recent studies report no adverse effects and similar outcomes with the combination, and the monoproduct carries higher misuse/diversion risk.",
  "In opioid-dependent individuals, adding naloxone to buprenorphine markedly reduced reinforcing and positive subjective effects and increased aversive/withdrawal effects when administered intravenously; naloxone’s very low sublingual/oral bioavailability underlies its inclusion as an abuse-deterrent, and larger absolute naloxone amounts may further deter parenteral misuse.",
  "The review describes that naloxone in the buprenorphine/naloxone combination has minimal effect when taken as directed due to poor gastrointestinal absorption but blocks buprenorphine’s effects when crushed/snorted or injected; it also notes Subutex can be used for patients who cannot tolerate naloxone and cites observational evidence of lower abuse rates with the combination compared with buprenorphine monotherapy.",
  "In auditory neuropathy, ABRs are absent or severely abnormal; ECochG reveals long-lasting cochlear microphonics (mean duration ~6.77 ms in AN) with oscillations that reverse phase between rarefaction and condensation clicks, indicating enduring CM activity.",
  "Auditory neuropathy typically presents with absent or severely abnormal ABR while CM is preserved; within ABR recordings the CM component is broad, can persist for up to 4–6 ms, and reverses with stimulus polarity, so polarity reversal (using insert earphones and tube-blocking to exclude artifacts) is recommended to confirm CM.",
  "In ANSD, ABR testing typically shows absent or grossly abnormal responses: patterns include flat tracings, early waves up to III with absent later waves, or poorly synchronized wave V only at high levels; distinguishing CM from ABR requires separate rarefaction/condensation trials because CM inverts with polarity while ABR does not.",
  "Auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony typically shows absent or grossly abnormal ABR waves even at high intensities, while cochlear microphonics are present and invert 180° between rarefaction and condensation clicks; this pattern reflects preserved outer hair cell function with disordered neural synchrony sufficient (sub-millisecond) to abolish the averaged ABR.",
  "In ANSD, ABR testing typically shows absent neural waves with prominent cochlear microphonics that reverse with stimulus polarity; CM can ring for several milliseconds (reported 4–6 ms), and longer analysis windows or toneburst stimuli may be needed to visualize these features.",
  "In this case report, ANSD presentation included absent click-evoked ABR and no click CM, while 2,000 Hz tone-burst ABR to condensation and rarefaction revealed robust, intensity-independent cochlear microphonics with poor neural ABR morphology, a pattern the authors identify as consistent with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder.",
  "Across Salmonella genomes, higher genome-wide Ka/Ks ratios—indicative of stronger genetic drift—are associated with both greater pseudogene abundance and the presence of more highly degraded pseudogenes, whereas genomes with lower Ka/Ks (higher selection efficacy) harbor fewer pseudogenes, indicating that drift promotes persistence while efficient selection accelerates removal.",
  "The review attributes genome reduction and the fate of nonessential DNA to the efficacy of purifying selection: in host-restricted symbionts, small population sizes and clonality render selection ineffective, allowing mutations to degrade genes and transiently accumulate pseudogenes and inert DNA before deletion yields tightly packed genomes.",
  "The paper emphasizes that the persistence and fixation of small or mildly deleterious genomic fragments during genomic decay are governed by the balance between genetic drift and the efficiency of natural selection; in small effective populations (low Ng), drift reduces selection’s purging power, enabling accumulation of such features in genome architecture.",
  "Genetic drift, governed by effective population size and demographic history, can overwhelm purifying selection in small populations, enabling TE insertions—particularly short, near-neutral fragments—to persist or even fix, thereby shaping genome size and architecture.",
  "In small asexual endosymbiont populations selection is relatively ineffective so mutational bias and Muller's ratchet increase fixation of mildly deleterious substitutions and influence genome base composition",
  "Under the drift-barrier hypothesis, the efficacy of natural selection to refine molecular traits is constrained by random genetic drift—negatively correlated with effective population size (Ne)—such that when beneficial effects become too small to overcome drift, further adaptive refinement halts, and directional mutational biases (e.g., deletion bias in prokaryotes) can shape genomic change.",
  "In Wolbachia wMel, the persistence of repetitive/mobile genomic elements is attributed to an overall inefficiency of natural selection—primarily driven by strong genetic drift and frequent population bottlenecks—which limits the removal of small, nonessential DNA fragments during genome streamlining.",
  "- Across diverse taxa, small indels are biased toward deletions; in prokaryotes this deletional bias correlates with higher gene density and is identified as the primary, selection-independent mechanism maintaining compact gene packing by purging nonfunctional DNA.",

  "Aryl bromides/iodides undergo rapid, low-temperature lithium–halogen exchange with n-BuLi to give aryllithiums, but side reactions such as Wurtz–Fittig coupling with cogenerated n-butyl halide can be problematic—particularly in THF—necessitating careful control of solvent and temperature.",
  "This paper details that trityl alcohols (Ar3COH) can be prepared by generating aryllithium via bromo–lithium exchange with n-BuLi at –78 °C and then adding diethyl carbonate in a 3:1 aryllithium-to-carbonate ratio (e.g., 3 equiv aryllithium, 1 equiv diethyl carbonate), yielding the corresponding trityl alcohol under these low-temperature conditions.",
  "The paper demonstrates that bromine–lithium exchange using n-butyllithium proceeds regioselectively on polybrominated biphenyls under cryogenic conditions (e.g., THF, −78 °C), enabling controlled formation of aryllithium intermediates that can be trapped with electrophiles to build functionalized biaryl frameworks.",
  "Naphthyl tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers undergo two-electron reduction with lithium to selectively cleave the Ar–O bond, generating an aryllithium at the former siloxy position alongside a siloxide, and the process benefits from the readily formed lithium naphthalenide compared to more challenging reductions of monocyclic benzene derivatives.",
  "Attempts to form trityl alcohols via addition of aryllithiums to diethyl carbonate failed under n-BuLi conditions (including in THF, which led to ~40% butylated aryl byproduct), whereas halogen–metal exchange followed by sec-BuLi in n-hexane and addition of diethyl carbonate produced the trityl alcohol in 80% yield.",
  "Formation of trityl alcohols via three additions of aryllithium to diethyl carbonate is a classical approach; in this work, efficient formation required halogen–lithium exchange followed by addition of diethyl carbonate in n-hexane with sec-BuLi, yielding the trityl alcohol in 80% under those conditions.",
  "PCA on four miRNAs (miR-101; miR-196b; miR-27b; miR-29c) captured most variance and enabled discrimination between leprosy and healthy controls as well as between LL and TT when followed by logistic regression and ROC analysis; the first two components explained 96.4% of variance for leprosy vs controls and the combined markers achieved 80% sensitivity and 91% specificity for this comparison, while also distinguishing LL from TT with 83% sensitivity and 80% specificity.",
  "In PCA, each observation’s PC scores position it in a low-dimensional (often 2D) PC1–PC2 map where the signs of scores are arbitrary and only relative positions and patterns matter; when PC1 and PC2 capture sufficient variance, clusters or groups can be visually identified in this space.",
  "The paper establishes that SVD (equivalent to PCA) transforms expression data into an eigengene/eigenarray space where genes or arrays can be classified into groups by their projections; practically, one can use two eigengenes (analogous to PCA1 and PCA2) to plot each gene’s correlations on orthogonal axes and sort/group them by similarity in these component-driven patterns.",

  "This paper establishes the γ-peptide 14-helix as a structure stabilized by 14-atom i,i+3 hydrogen-bonded rings, shows that cyclically constrained γ-residues intrinsically favor this conformation, and reports characteristic helical parameters (~2.5 residues/turn, ~5.5 Å pitch) and diagnostic NOE patterns for identifying the 14-helix in solution.",
  "An α/ɛ-hybrid peptide with 1:1 alternation has been reported to form a mixed H14/12 helix (by 1H NMR), while cyclopentane-based ε-amino acid oligomers (Amc5a) independently prefer H16 helices; these findings establish helix-type benchmarks for alternating α/ε sequences and ε-rich foldamers.",

  "In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rifampin resistance and patterns of cross-resistance to rifamycin analogs predominantly arise from specific point mutations within an 81-bp region of rpoB; experimentally introducing these mutations alone is sufficient to confer the rifamycin-resistant phenotype, indicating that chromosomal mutations (without lateral gene transfer) can drive resistance.",
  "In M. tuberculosis, which lacks resistance plasmids and has limited horizontal gene transfer, drug resistance evolves via chromosomal mutations that arise spontaneously at measurable rates (≈10−8–10−9 per cell division for key drugs), making resistance likely under monotherapy, and individual resistance mutations can also produce cross-resistance to related drugs.",

  "Single mutations in the transcriptional repressor Rv0678 can derepress the mmpS5–mmpL5 efflux system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causing ≈11-fold increased mmpL5 expression and conferring cross-resistance to clofazimine and bedaquiline via an efflux-mediated, multisubstrate mechanism independent of target mutation or horizontal gene transfer.",
  "In Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance evolves via chromosomal mutations and is frequently followed by fitness compensatory mutations in RNA polymerase subunits which restore growth and can increase resistance even without ongoing antibiotic selection",
  "M. tuberculosis develops antibiotic resistance without horizontal gene transfer by accumulating chromosomal mutations under antibiotic selection; sublethal bactericidal antibiotic exposure can further promote radical-induced mutagenesis that drives multidrug resistance, and subsequent compensatory mutations can restore fitness of resistant strains, stabilizing their spread.",
  "In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, acquired drug resistance occurs through chromosomal mutations under antibiotic selection rather than horizontal gene transfer; sublethal bactericidal antibiotic exposure can elevate mutagenesis via reactive oxygen species, and compensatory mutations (e.g., in RNA polymerase of rifampicin-resistant strains) can restore fitness, stabilizing resistant lineages.",
  "Despite lacking horizontal gene transfer and exhibiting little recombination, Mycobacterium tuberculosis acquires resistance via chromosomal mutations that can arise before treatment and persist as heteroresistance; the emergence and persistence of these mutants are shaped by mutation rates, population size, mutational target size, and fitness effects, with compensatory mutations (e.g., in rpoA/rpoC for rpoB-mediated rifampicin resistance) reducing fitness costs and facilitating spread.",
  "In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, drug resistance arises through vertically inherited chromosomal mutations (not lateral gene transfer or plasmids), can evolve rapidly within a host via stepwise acquisition under drug pressure, and is facilitated by compensatory mutations that mitigate fitness costs and are linked to successful transmission and higher resistance rates.",
  "Despite lacking horizontal gene transfer and having a conserved genome, M. tuberculosis acquires drug resistance via spontaneous chromosomal mutations; fitness costs can be offset by compensatory mutations, and low-frequency within-host variants that confer advantage can expand and transmit, enabling rapid emergence and spread of resistance.",
  "In a highly clonal bacterium lacking recent horizontal gene transfer, extensive polymorphisms in DNA repair/recombination/replication genes and the absence of mismatch repair can relax genome maintenance fidelity, creating mutator-like conditions that may initiate the evolution of antibiotic resistance under stressful conditions.",
  "In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rifampin resistance due to rpoB mutations can incur fitness costs, yet strains may persist through compensatory mutations (commonly in rpoA/rpoC or potentially other genes) and epistatic interactions (e.g., gyrA mutations) that mitigate fitness penalties and can facilitate progression to broader drug resistance.",
  "- In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, drug resistance arises without horizontal gene transfer, instead emerging via chromosomal mutations and efflux pump activation; examples include inhA mutations or overexpression that confer INH/ETH coresistance, and oxyR’-ahpC intergenic mutations that upregulate ahpC to compensate for reduced KatG activity.",
  "In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, loss-of-function mutations in pepQ (Rv2535c) selected during bedaquiline ± clofazimine treatment confer approximately fourfold increases in bedaquiline and clofazimine MICs; susceptibility is restored by pepQ complementation, and efflux inhibitors reverse the MIC elevations, indicating a non-target, efflux-associated cross-resistance mechanism arising without horizontal gene transfer.",
  "The review explains that bacterial resistance can originate de novo through chromosomal mutations (independent of horizontal gene transfer) and that second-site compensatory mutations, which can arise within a few generations, restore fitness without compromising resistance, helping resistant strains persist and spread.",
  "For a single contrasting trait, Mendel’s experiments established that self-fertilized hybrids produce F2 progeny with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (dominant:recessive), corresponding to the developmental series A + 2Aa + a, which distinguishes genotypes in a 2:1:1 ratio (homozygous dominant:heterozygous:homozygous recessive).",
  "Native mass spectrometry preserves noncovalent assemblies to measure intact complex masses and stoichiometries and can reveal different oligomeric states and equilibrium changes, but because detection occurs in the gas phase the observed species distributions can differ from those in solution.",
  "In rye populations, outcrossing rates typically range between approximately 0.70 and 0.95 (depending on estimator and population), self-pollination does occur, and reduced plant (pollen) density significantly lowers outcrossing by weakening the self-incompatibility system.",
  "RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases act with E2 enzymes to transfer ubiquitin directly from E2~Ub to substrates, and the resulting ubiquitin linkage type determines substrate fate; notably, K48-linked chains of four or more ubiquitins typically signal proteasomal degradation.",
  "Mendelian inheritance is defined by allele segregation and independent assortment during meiosis, enabling prediction of offspring genotypic ratios (e.g., 1:2:1 from heterozygote crosses), while phenotypic ratios can vary without altering the underlying Mendelian transmission.",
  "Agroinfiltration enables transient gene expression from Agrobacterium-delivered T-DNA in plant leaves, but its efficiency is constrained by temperature (≥29 °C blocks T-DNA transfer due to pilus failure) and by host RNA silencing unless mitigated by co-expressing viral silencing suppressors.",
  "Plant E3 ubiquitin ligases confer substrate specificity in the ubiquitination pathway, marking targets for 26S proteasome degradation; RING-type E3 activity requires an intact zinc-coordinating RING domain, and E3 ligases also regulate abiotic stress responses by ubiquitinating key stress regulators.",
  "In a field population of rye (cv. JNK), the overall selfing rate was near 35%, with B chromosomes associated with reduced selfing (~20% with Bs) compared to plants without Bs (~45%), and rye generally is predominantly outcrossing though selfing can range 0–30% in natural populations.",
  "Native mass spectrometry preserves intact, noncovalent protein assemblies and, under non-denaturing conditions, enables determination of subunit composition and stoichiometry from the measured mass of the intact complex while also revealing multiple coexisting complexes within a single spectrum.",
  "Mendel’s work established that in monohybrid crosses F2 phenotypes typically segregate 3:1, corresponding to a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio, and that alleles segregate during gamete formation while different allele pairs assort independently.",
  "Rye is generally a predominantly outcrossing species due to a gametophytic incompatibility system, with 'predominantly outcrossing' defined as a self-fertilization rate below 5%; nonetheless, selfing can vary across years and conditions, exemplified by the Merced cultivar having ~100% outcrossing in one generation but ~9% single-locus (20% multilocus) selfing in the previous generation.",
  "Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in tobacco leaf epidermal cells is rapid (approximately 2–4 days), supports co-expression of multiple constructs by mixing Agrobacterium cultures before infiltration, and enables downstream verification of expressed proteins from infiltrated leaf tissue using antibody-based Western blots.",
  "In Nicotiana benthamiana, Agrobacterium-mediated co-infiltration can be performed by mixing strains carrying different plasmids at a 1:1 ratio, and applying a 37°C, 30-minute heat shock at 1–2 days post-infiltration increases transient protein accumulation by approximately four- to fivefold.",
  "SDIR1 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase in Arabidopsis whose E3 activity depends on an intact RING domain; E3 ligases facilitate ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of substrates, and SDIR1 overexpression confers ABA hypersensitivity and enhanced drought tolerance.",
  "In plants, E3 ubiquitin ligases confer substrate recognition during ubiquitination, and polyubiquitin chains (>4) typically target proteins for 26S proteasome degradation; numerous RING-type E3s modulate ABA-linked signaling and positively regulate drought, salt, and heat stress responses, with some (e.g., SDIR1, AIRP1, RHA2b, OsHTAS) enhancing tolerance and XERICO increasing drought tolerance via ABA biosynthesis.",
  "Prp19 exemplifies a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase whose U-box domains dimerize within a tetrameric assembly; disrupting this U-box dimer interface abolishes dimer formation and is lethal in vivo, and the U-box/RING domain provides the E2 recruitment function while separate domains mediate substrate recognition.",
  "Native mass spectrometry can define stoichiometry and characterize protein–protein complexes, and modern platforms (e.g., IM–Orbitrap) can accurately measure complexes across a broad mass range from single-subunit proteins to large assemblies spanning ~8.6–810 kDa and even MDa-size particles.",
  "E3 ubiquitin ligases can promote proteasomal degradation of substrates, their activity often depends on oligomerization (frequently forming homo-/heterodimers), and catalytically inactive mutants may still bind substrates and compete with the wild type, acting in a dominant-negative manner.",
  "In tumors, copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity is defined as allelic imbalance without an associated copy-number change (i.e., copy-neutral), and the term uniparental disomy (UPD) is used for the analogous germline finding, indicating maintained gene dosage despite loss of heterozygosity.",
  "In JMML/NF-1 cases, loss of heterozygosity at NF1 frequently arises through segmental uniparental disomy on 17q caused by mitotic recombination, which preserves normal NF1 copy number (copy-neutral LOH) as shown by MLPA.",
  "The paper defines copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity as uniparental disomy (UPD), often arising through mitotic recombination, and emphasizes that such UPD is detectable by SNP arrays but not by metaphase cytogenetics.",
  "In colorectal tumors at the APC locus, loss of heterozygosity commonly occurs through mitotic recombination/break-induced replication, which converts heterozygous regions to homozygosity without altering DNA copy number (i.e., copy-neutral LOH).",
  "Copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity in myeloid malignancies is often equivalent to uniparental disomy and commonly arises through mitotic recombination; it can also occur when a prior deletion is corrected via homologous recombination using the homologous chromosome, producing loss of heterozygosity without altering overall copy number.",
  "After femoral access for cardiac catheterization, a pseudoaneurysm presents as a pulsatile mass with a bruit, whereas an arteriovenous fistula results from arterial–venous puncture communication and is associated with a thrill or continuous bruit on examination.",
  "Iatrogenic femoral arteriovenous fistulas following percutaneous groin catheterization can present with a palpable thrill and audible bruit at the access site and may contribute to high-output cardiac failure.",
  "Following femoral arterial access for cardiac catheterization, an iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula can present with a continuous bruit and palpable thrill at the groin, and diagnosis is primarily supported by these characteristic physical findings.",
  "After femoral arterial catheterization, iatrogenic femoral arteriovenous fistulas are an uncommon complication that can present at the groin with a palpable thrill and a continuous audible bruit; other limb findings may include swelling and pulse deficits.",
  "After transfemoral arterial access, a palpable thrill and audible bruit at the puncture site suggest either an arteriovenous fistula (palpable thrill and audible bruit) or a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (pulsatile mass with thrill or murmur), whereas a hematoma typically presents as a nonpulsatile mass or ecchymosis.",
  "Iatrogenic AVFs commonly follow percutaneous femoral access during cardiac catheterization and present with a palpable thrill and continuous or machinery-like murmur while pseudoaneurysms often appear as a pulsatile mass and require Doppler ultrasound to distinguish.",
  "At femoral access sites, an arteriovenous fistula is associated with a palpable thrill and a pansystolic bruit at the groin, whereas a pseudoaneurysm typically presents with a pulsatile mass and a systolic bruit; duplex ultrasound is used to evaluate both.",
  "Post-femoral catheterization arteriovenous fistulas result from direct arterial-venous puncture site communication and on examination are associated with a palpable thrill and an audible bruit at the groin.",
  "The study emphasizes that compensation requires single-stained controls that are at least as bright as the experimental samples, the use of separate negative controls (not the negatives within single-stain tubes) to avoid autofluorescence mismatch and nonspecific binding, and collection of controls and samples on the same day due to day-to-day variability in fluorochrome spectra that can impair correction.",
  "For multicolor flow cytometry, the paper specifies that a five-color panel requires five FMO controls; in addition, it recommends using an unstained, fully processed sample to assess autofluorescence and singly labeled controls (or antibody-binding particles) to establish spectral compensation and evaluate background due to spillover.",
  "In multicolor flow cytometry, experiments should include setup/instrument controls, specificity/gating controls, and biological comparison controls; compensation must be determined using single-stained controls (beads or cells) for each fluorochrome used, while FMO or isotype gating controls are optional and only needed for markers with ambiguous positive/negative separation.",
  "MIFlowCyt requires documentation of quality control measures (including control assays), clear reporting of fluorescence compensation type, and provision of the spillover/compensation matrix when available, reflecting the need to capture essential controls and compensation details in multicolor flow cytometry experiments.",
  "For accurate compensation in multi-color flow cytometry, the paper specifies including single-stained compensation controls for each reagent (on cells or antibody-capture beads) plus a negative, unstained control; adding FMO controls for every channel where positive/negative gating must be set; and collecting compensation controls together with the experiment’s samples rather than reusing prior compensation matrices.",
  "In multicolor flow cytometry, proper compensation is calculated from single-stained compensation controls, and accurate identification of positive events requires fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls—staining with all reagents except the marker of interest—because compensation-induced spreading makes visual gating (e.g., quadrants) unreliable in log-scaled data.",
  "The paper defines an explicit link between dilute-solution interaction parameters and the osmotic second virial coefficient (B2 = kS + kD + ν²/M), explains that positive B2 indicates net repulsion while negative B2 indicates net attraction, and warns that static light scattering B2 values can include nonassociative steric (excluded volume and protein–solute) contributions that depend on ionic strength and pH.",
  "The paper defines a reduced virial coefficient Ψ ≡ B22/B22,ST for mAbs, determines B22 from SLS using Debye–Zimm analysis, and reports a steric-only reference value B22,ST ≈ 10 mL/g for IgG1 antibodies.",
  "For an IgG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb1) at pH 5.0 in acetate buffer with NaCl (0–100 mM), the second virial coefficient B2—related to interaction parameters by B2 = ks + kD + n2/M—decreases with increasing NaCl, with values as low as 0.38×10−4 mole-mL/gm2 under near-isotonic conditions; sedimentation-equilibrium-derived values are termed osmotic second virial coefficients (solute–solute only), whereas SLS-derived values include solute/co-solute contributions.",
  "The paper defines a ‘bare’ second osmotic virial coefficient, independent of electrostatic contributions, via B2(0) = B2 − Z^2/(4 Cs), and notes that the remaining short-range (hydration/van der Waals) attractions are approximately salt-independent, while B2 values are experimentally obtained from static light scattering.",
  "In this study, the steric-only (hard-sphere) contribution to the osmotic second virial coefficient was taken as 0.19 × 10^-4 mol mL/g^2 (W=0), negative B 22 indicates net attraction, and NaCl conditions generally produced the weakest attractions among salts examined.",
  "The paper defines the reduced second osmotic virial coefficient b2 as normalized by the hard-sphere excluded-volume term BHS2 (the steric-only contribution) and explains that negative B22 indicates net attractive protein–protein interactions while positive B22 indicates repulsion, providing the framework needed to interpret or convert measured B22 values relative to steric-only behavior.",
  "For dilute IgG1 antibody solutions, the steric-only second osmotic virial coefficient (B22,ST) is approximately 0.01 L/g and is used as a c2-independent reference to normalize measured B22 values; B22/B22,ST > 1 indicates net-repulsive interactions relative to sterics, while B22/B22,ST < 1 indicates net-attractive interactions.",
  "The study defines a dimensionless reduced virial coefficient Y = B22/B22,ST and reports a steric-only second osmotic virial coefficient B22,ST ≈ 10 mL/g for IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, providing a baseline to interpret measured B22 values relative to steric effects.",
  "Photoactivatable caged electrophile probes enable UV-dependent cysteine labeling, showing minimal labeling without irradiation and increased signal after light exposure, with detection achieved by CuAAC installation of a fluorescent tag followed by SDS-PAGE in-gel fluorescence imaging.",
  "The study details a CuAAC workflow for proteome labeling in 2 mg/mL cell lysates: cysteine residues are first modified with an IA-alkyne probe, then conjugated to azide-bearing, isotopically labeled TEV-cleavable tags using CuSO4, TBTA, and TCEP at room temperature for 1 hour prior to downstream analysis.",
  "Thioxanthone possesses high triplet energy and operates via energy transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, and single-electron transfer; notably, it efficiently sensitizes molecular oxygen to singlet oxygen under visible light, and experimental evidence shows singlet oxygen acts as the oxidant in thioxanthone-catalyzed alcohol oxidations.",
  "Dimethyl fumarate is an electrophilic fumaric acid ester that reacts with cysteine thiols via Michael addition (succination), including on Keap1 Cys151 and GAPDH active-site cysteines, and it can also form glutathione conjugates; these thiol-directed reactions underpin its biological activity.",
  "9H‑thioxanthen‑9‑one (a thioxanthone) functions as an efficient triplet sensitizer for o‑nitrobenzyl‑type protecting groups: upon excitation it undergoes intersystem crossing and transfers triplet energy to the nitrobenzyl chromophore, thereby enhancing uncaging efficiency and speed with near diffusion‑controlled bimolecular quenching kinetics and demonstrated effectiveness in both solution and surface (microarray) contexts.",
  "This study uses an alkyne-iodoacetamide cysteine probe followed by copper-catalyzed click chemistry with fluorescent azides (e.g., rhodamine-azide) to enable SDS-PAGE in-gel fluorescence readouts that reflect differential probe labeling of proteins, demonstrating that fluorescence intensity changes track with cysteine reactivity and extent of labeling.",
  "In aqueous photolysis of p-hydroxyphenacyl esters, light produces two major products—the released acid leaving group and a rearranged p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid—via a triplet pathway involving an oxyallyl–phenoxy triplet biradical (I1) and spirodienedione (I2), while radical-derived reduction products are characteristic of aprotic solvents and were not observed in the aqueous photolyzates.",
  "9H-thioxanthen-9-one functions as an effective triplet sensitizer that accelerates photodeprotection of 2-nitrophenyl-based protecting groups, enabling higher signal at lower light doses on microarray surfaces (e.g., reaching maximum intensity at 4 J/cm2 vs 12 J/cm2 without sensitizer) and supporting its designation as the most suitable sensitizer among those tested.",
  "Upon UV activation (~355 nm), alkyl diazirines generate a carbene that forms covalent insertions into protein bonds; subsequent Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne click conjugates a fluorescent azide reporter to the probe’s alkyne, enabling visualization of photo-crosslinked proteins on SDS-PAGE.",
  "For traumatic cardiac arrest, if necessary pre-hospital interventions (e.g., thoracotomy) cannot be delivered, guidelines advise rapid transfer to an appropriate emergency department, while noting that survival after transport in established traumatic cardiac arrest is rare.",
  "Poison control centers conduct rapid, time-sensitive telephone triage to determine urgency and whether to refer individuals for immediate in-person care, provide clinical toxicology consultation to both the public and healthcare professionals, and note that failure to follow recommendations to seek facility-based care can increase risk of serious injury or death.",
  "Level I trauma centers provide comprehensive, definitive care for all aspects of injury, whereas lower-level centers (e.g., Level IV) primarily stabilize patients and transfer them to higher-level centers; Level II centers can manage most injuries but may refer tertiary needs (e.g., cardiac surgery) to Level I centers.",
  "For traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, this review reports evidence recommending active field resuscitation rather than quick transport when anticipated transport exceeds 15 minutes, notes NAEMSP/ACS-COT guidance to withhold resuscitation for blunt trauma patients without signs of life, and highlights studies suggesting prehospital triage is unreliable and that transporting such patients to the ED for further evaluation may be warranted.",
  "The 2021 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients recommends that high-risk trauma be transported to the highest-level trauma center when feasible, but specifies that patients in extremis (e.g., unstable airway, severe shock, or traumatic arrest) may require transport to the closest hospital for initial stabilization before transfer; the guideline emphasizes that time is crucial and favors short transport intervals.",
  "PCCs are staffed by nurses and pharmacists under the supervision of board-certified medical toxicologists, their utilization is associated with improved patient outcomes, and some countries maintain hospital-based poison treatment centers that specialize in clinical toxicology and serve as repositories for antidotes.",
  "For blunt trauma patients who are pulseless on ED arrival, EDT is conditionally recommended only when signs of life (pupillary response, spontaneous ventilation, carotid pulse, measurable/palpable blood pressure, extremity movement, or cardiac electrical activity) are present, and conditionally recommended against when signs of life are absent; these recommendations predominantly derive from studies conducted at major urban trauma centers and may have limited applicability in community or rural settings.",
  "For traumatic cardiac arrest after blunt trauma, RT is recommended when pre-hospital CPR is under 10 minutes; effective management occurs in settings where the ER operates 24/7 with an embedded OR enabling direct transfer for ongoing arrest, and where an experienced interdisciplinary team with the infrastructure and surgical expertise (including organ and vessel repair) is available.",
  "Early initiation of N-acetylcysteine after acetaminophen overdose reduces hepatotoxicity and mortality, with intravenous NAC recommended for unconscious or critically ill patients requiring intensive monitoring, and treatment ideally started within 8 hours (and no later than 24 hours) from ingestion.",
  "In acute liver failure—particularly acetaminophen overdose—patients with unstable hemodynamics, renal failure, altered mental status, advanced encephalopathy, or poor prognosis should receive ICU-level care and be transferred or promptly referred to a liver transplant center early in the course.",
  "Alternating α,δ-hybrid peptides (including L-alanine as the α-residue and a cyclic δ-residue) adopt a 13/11 helix (specifically the 13/11(II) form) with α-residues embedded within the helix and δ-residues on the exterior, as demonstrated by X-ray crystallography and NMR.",
  "In aqueous solution, β-peptide 14-helices (i,i−2 hydrogen bonds forming a 14-atom ring) are most effectively stabilized by incorporating cyclically constrained residues such as ACHC, which confer high 14-helical stability with minimal sensitivity to pH and ionic strength, and even a small proportion (e.g., two ACHC residues in a heptamer) is sufficient to strongly promote 14-helicity.",
  "In heterogeneous foldamers composed of alternating α-amino acids and extended backbones (e.g., β or γ), characteristic mixed helices with alternating hydrogen-bond ring sizes (such as 9/11, 12/10, or 11/13) are observed, demonstrating that backbone extension and alternation systematically dictate helical “x/y” patterns.",
  "An alternating 1:1 α/δ-amino acid sequence forms a mixed 13/11 helix with alternating i,i−11 and i,i−13 intramolecular hydrogen bonds; within this topology, α-residues are embedded inside the helix while δ-residues face outward, supported by NMR and XRD data.",
  "An α/ɛ-hybrid hexapeptide built from alternating y-Ala and a cyclic ε-amino acid [(S)-ε-Caa(x)] was experimentally suggested to adopt a mixed H14/12 helix by 1H NMR, indicating that alternating α/ε sequences with cyclic ε residues can form H14/12 helical patterns.",
  "In alternating α/ε-hybrid peptides built from L-Ala and (S)-C-linked carbo-ε-amino acid monomers, the study targets a 14/12-helix; ab initio calculations on alternating α/ε octamers list multiple helix types, with the H14/12 helix exhibiting the lowest relative energy at the B3LYP level (0.0 kJ/mol), while H12/14 is also computed among low-energy structures.",
  "This paper defines the γ-peptide 14-helix as an i,i+3 hydrogen-bonded structure forming 14-atom rings and also notes that β-peptides exhibit multiple helix types (14-, 12-, 10/12-, 10-, and 14/16-helices), illustrating helix nomenclature based on hydrogen-bond ring sizes across foldamer backbones.",
  "Alternating α/δ-hybrid peptides (1:1 α- and δ-amino acids) preferentially adopt a mixed 13/11 helix: theory identifies HI 13=11 as most stable even in aqueous conditions, and NMR experiments confirm 13/11-mixed helical patterns in synthesized sequences.",
  "Helical nomenclature across different backbones maps to hydrogen-bonding patterns and atom counts: for β-peptides, the 12-helix corresponds to i,i+3 C=O…H-N H-bonds; in 1:1 α/β-peptides, i,i+3 and i,i+4 variants are termed the 11- and 14/15-helices, respectively; for α-peptides, these correspond to the 3 10-helix (i,i+3) and α-helix (i,i+4).",
  "This patent highlight describes ADCs for inflammatory diseases composed of antibodies (targeting CD74 or CD163) linked via phosphate-based linkers to glucocorticoid receptor agonists (e.g., dexamethasone), with preclinical characterization including solubility, in vitro stability, mouse serum and pharmacokinetic stability, aggregation, and in vitro targeted delivery assessments.",
  "Exposure-response (dose- or concentration-response) data are fundamental for establishing drug safety and efficacy; well-controlled dose-response studies allow comparison of benefits and risks across doses, help avoid unnecessary toxicity from excessive dosing, and should use prospective hypotheses, appropriate controls, randomization, and reliable response assessments.",
  "In a phase 2 PMR trial, ABBV-154 (adalimumab conjugated to a glucocorticoid receptor modulator) prolonged time to flare versus placebo (HRs 0.49, 0.44, 0.20 across 40/150/340 mg), reduced glucocorticoid exposure by week 24, and was generally well tolerated; interpretation is limited by early study termination and absence of an adalimumab comparator.",
  "The review reports that anti‑TNF–GRM antibody–drug conjugates (e.g., ABBV‑3373) were more effective than anti‑TNF monoclonal antibodies in chronic mouse arthritis models and reduced glucocorticoid‑related systemic side effects, aligning with the rationale that targeted GRM delivery minimizes systemic exposure and supports chronic dosing.",
  "Regulators now expect oncology programs to study multiple dose levels to identify optimal dosing; relying on a single dose limits exposure variability and can hinder detection of exposure–response, and for ADCs specifically, analyses must determine whether total antibody or the cytotoxic payload exposure is the causally relevant driver—often necessitating more complex modeling to separate component contributions.",
  "Glucocorticoids achieve broad anti-inflammatory effects, in part via GR–NF-κB cooperative gene regulation that promotes resolution and tissue repair, yet historical attempts to design improved GR ligands to reduce side effects have not produced clinically adopted drugs.",
  "Fosdagrocorat, a partial glucocorticoid receptor agonist, is supported by preclinical data indicating dissociation between anti-inflammatory efficacy and bone-related adverse effects (including a four-fold dissociation vs prednisone for bone formation inhibition), while this 2-week clinical study in RA showed symptomatic efficacy but did not provide clear biomarker evidence of dissociation.",
  "ABBV-3373 (an anti-TNF–GRM ADC) is designed to selectively deliver a glucocorticoid receptor modulator to transmembrane TNF–expressing immune cells to enhance efficacy while minimizing systemic GRM exposure; in an exposure-matched, active-controlled trial versus adalimumab, antibody exposures were comparable and multiple dosing showed no apparent impact on serum cortisol, supporting a fair efficacy comparison and suggesting minimal HPA-axis effects.",
  "ICH E4 emphasizes that defining dose-response for both beneficial and undesirable effects should use robust designs—typically parallel, randomized fixed-dose studies with multiple dose levels (often including placebo); for combination therapies, factorial trials can quantify each component’s contribution and inform dosing for the components both alone and in combination.",
  "In a mouse FITC-induced contact hypersensitivity model, ear swelling is observed 24 hours post-challenge and depends on the presence of dibutyl phthalate during sensitization or elicitation; the model exhibits a Th2-dominant profile with increased IL-4 and is associated with induction of TNF in inflamed ear tissue.",
  "In a 12-week phase IIb RA trial, fosdagrocorat 10–15 mg achieved efficacy comparable to prednisone 10 mg with a safety profile closer to prednisone 5 mg; at 1–10 mg, P1NP changes met non-inferiority to prednisone 5 mg while uNTx:uCr results were variable, and all fosdagrocorat doses reduced HbA1c.",
  "In arthritis, selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (e.g., fosdagrocorat/PF-04171327) can demonstrate better clinical anti-inflammatory efficacy with similar safety to prednisone, but bone-related adverse effects such as osteoporosis involve both transrepression and transactivation pathways; establishing equipotent dosing between SGRMs and glucocorticoids is difficult, adverse effects increase with higher SGRM doses, and many preclinical safety measures (e.g., glucose levels, cortical bone thickness) are surrogate markers rather than clinical outcomes.",
  "In a mouse model of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, prednisolone decreased total and trabecular bone mineral density and lowered cross-sectional moment of inertia, whereas the selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator Compound A maintained bone mineral density and strength, did not increase RANKL/OPG or DKK-1, and still suppressed proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6).",
  "In murine hapten-induced cutaneous inflammation, administering anti-TNF antibody immediately before challenge abrogates ear swelling, inhibits both contact hypersensitivity and irritant reactions, suppresses the rapid (>0.5 h) and sustained (>72 h) increase in TNF mRNA, and reduces dermal and epidermal pathological features, demonstrating a central, auto-amplified role for TNF in these responses.",
  "The study’s procedures highlight the oxygen sensitivity of hydroquinone redox chemistry: aerobic oxidation experiments deliberately supply O2 (balloon or defined O2 pressure), whereas anaerobic conditions require deoxygenated solvent via freeze–pump–thaw, demonstrating that the presence or absence of oxygen is a critical experimental variable.",
  "Activated 3 Å molecular sieves at 20% m/v can dry THF to low single-digit ppm water content within 48–72 hours, achieving sub-10 ppm moisture levels and providing reliably very dry solvent.",
  "The guide emphasizes rigorous exclusion of air and moisture in sensitive syntheses: use oven-dried glassware with repeated vacuum/inert-gas cycling, maintain a positive inert-gas atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen/argon), and employ properly dried, degassed solvents via solvent purification systems or activated molecular sieves, with water content verifiable by Karl Fischer or ketyl tests.",
  "The study demonstrates that hydroquinone is rapidly oxidized to benzoquinone in THF under 1 atm O2 with a PAJ-Fe-N-C catalyst, and that catalytic base (NaOtBu) further accelerates this aerobic oxidation.",
  "In THF, iodide salts (NaI or LiI) profoundly change NaH reactivity: NaH acts as a hydride donor under these conditions, and using an alkyl iodide (e.g., MeI) with NaH can generate NaI in situ and lead to unexpected reactions (e.g., hydrodecyanation), with the authors noting their NaH/iodide-mediated processes were carried out without special precautions.",
  "The study shows that for moisture-sensitive reactions, drying the ether solvent with 3 Å molecular sieves and minimizing exposure to air (e.g., via nitrogen purging) are crucial; atmospheric air contact reduced conversion to below 20%, consistent with detrimental effects from moisture.",
  "The study shows that in NaH-mediated alkylations, DMF and acetonitrile can participate in side reactions due to NaH’s base/hydride behavior, producing solvent-derived byproducts that consume alkyl halides and reduce yields, indicating these solvents can complicate such transformations.",
  "The study shows that mono-phenols (via their phenolate forms) can be oxidized to para-benzoquinones using molecular oxygen—commonly under an oxygen atmosphere in DMF/H2O with [CoII(salen)] catalyst—through a mechanism where the phenolate is one-electron oxidized to a phenoxy radical that reacts with O2 to form the quinone.",
  "In drug addiction, the insula is centrally implicated in craving and awareness processes (including bilateral anterior insula co-activation during perceptual awareness), and studies of cannabis users show blunted insula and anterior cingulate responses associated with reduced error awareness.",
  "Resting-state fMRI shows that cocaine-dependent individuals exhibit altered insular cortex connectivity—predominantly involving the right insula—with increased coupling to prefrontal control regions (right inferior frontal gyrus, dorsomedial PFC, bilateral dorsolateral PFC) and reduced coupling with dorsal posterior insula; conjunction analyses identify the right insula as the main locus of common group differences across prefrontal networks.",
  "In abstinent cocaine-dependent adults, interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity is reduced—particularly in prefrontal regions and across homotopic and heterotopic connections within the dorsal attention network—while diffusion tensor imaging shows no group differences, indicating functional but not detectable white matter microstructural alterations.",
  "In nicotine-dependent smokers without Axis I psychiatric disorders, exposure to smoking cues increases functional connectivity between the right anterior insula and default mode regions (precuneus and left angular gyrus), and stronger right anterior insula–precuneus connectivity is positively associated with greater cue-induced craving.",
  "In daily smokers after overnight abstinence, resting-state connectivity between the right ventral anterior insula and posterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is positively associated with nicotine withdrawal severity—driven by craving and physical symptoms—and this association is not observed after smoking.",
  "In a highly comorbid psychiatric patient sample, substance abuse was associated with increased interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity of the insula and inferior frontal cortex and decreased fractional anisotropy in multiple brain regions including the corpus callosum.",
  "FST (and its equivalent θ) quantifies genetic differentiation among populations as the proportion of genetic diversity attributable to differences in allele frequencies; increased migration (gene flow) makes populations more similar and thus lowers FST, whereas limited migration allows higher FST to accumulate.",
  "Under models with gene flow after secondary contact, increasing opportunity for gene flow should reduce genomic differentiation (FST) and reduce sequence divergence (dxy) in homogenized regions, while only genomic regions resistant to introgression are expected to retain elevated FST and dxy.",
  "The paper defines nucleotide diversity as the average number of pairwise nucleotide differences per site within a population; for mitochondrial DNA it is approximately 2 N_m μ; and net divergence between populations is computed as π_xy minus the average of within-population π values.",
  "Under neutrality the within-population average pairwise nucleotide differences has expectation 4Nu (with u the mutation rate per generation per DNA sequence and N the effective population size), so this average directly estimates 4Nu from within-population DNA polymorphism data.",
  "F*ST is explicitly linked to expected heterozygosity and homozygosity (F*ST = (hT − hS)/hT = (fS − fT)/(1 − fT)) and lies between 0 and 1; it is an appropriate measure of gene-frequency differentiation only when genetic diversity is low, a condition often met at the nucleotide/codon level where nucleotide diversities are generally low.",
  "The study estimates the human germline base-substitution mutation rate at 12.85 ×10−9 per site per generation and notes it is higher than in several model organisms, while emphasizing that the human germline per-cell division mutation rate is lower than in other species.",
  "Under neutrality, per-site heterozygosity (nucleotide diversity) scales as approximately 4Ne·u, and the total number of heterozygous nucleotide sites per individual in a finite population is H(1/2N) ≈ 2vm·(Ne/N), indicating dependence on mutation rate and effective population size rather than the number of sites.",
  "Background selection reduces nucleotide site diversity (pi) at linked neutral sites, with the reduction scaling with the total deleterious mutation rate (U) and effectively reducing Ne by a factor f0; in selfing/inbreeding populations, neutral diversity expectations incorporate the inbreeding coefficient via Ne = N/(1 + F).",
  "Weir & Cockerham (1984) define three correlation parameters for population structure: F (within-individual inbreeding), θ (coancestry between individuals within populations, often corresponding to FST), and f (within-population inbreeding; corresponding to FIS), related by f = (F − θ)/(1 − θ); they emphasize that these depend on population size/history rather than sampling scheme, and that only f can be estimated from a single population, while under random mating F and θ are not distinct.",
  "Within-population nucleotide diversity (π) reflects the balance of mutation input and drift, scaling with mutation rate (u) and effective population size (Ne); it is less sensitive to migration than pooled samples, and is reduced by inbreeding/self-fertilization due to lowered Ne.",
  "At mutation–drift equilibrium, silent-site nucleotide diversity (πs) equals ~4Ne u in diploids (2Ne u in haploids), and empirically u shows a strong negative relationship with Ne; therefore, within-population diversity depends on both Ne and u, with higher πs arising from higher u or larger Ne but moderated by the tendency for u to decrease as Ne increases.",
  "Under the infinite-sites neutral model in a finite randomly mating population, equilibrium within-population nucleotide diversity (mean pairwise differences) equals 4N times the per-cistron mutation rate, heterozygosity satisfies h/(1 − h) = 4Nv, and after a split with no migration the mean number of differences between populations increases linearly with time at twice the mutation rate.",
  "Wright defines FST as the ratio of the actual variance of gene frequencies among subdivisions to its maximum possible value; under migration–drift balance in the island model, FST equals 1/(4Nm + 1), showing that higher migration (m) and larger deme size (N) reduce between-population differentiation, FST is necessarily positive, and FIS can be negative under systematic avoidance of consanguinity, with mutation and universal dispersion limiting increases in FIS.",
  "Under the neutral infinite-sites model in a randomly mating population without migration, the expected average number of nucleotide differences within a population (π) equals M = 4Nv, directly linking within-population diversity to the mutation rate (v) and effective population size (N).",
  "The fossilized birth–death model integrates fossils and extant taxa—including the possibility of sampled ancestors (yf = zf)—and explicitly allows inclusion of all available fossils, which has been shown to improve the accuracy of inferences about speciation and extinction patterns.",
  "The study demonstrates that transmission sampled-ancestor birth–death models are unidentifiable (likelihood depends only on λ−μ−ψ, λψ, and ψ(1−r)), but incorporating fossil tips and sampled ancestors under the fossilized birth–death framework (no removal after sampling) yields identifiability of all four parameters; in unidentifiable cases, one parameter must be fixed or strongly constrained by priors to enable inference.",
  "Restricting birth–death models to piecewise polynomial rate functions (including piecewise-constant and spline models with any finite number of pieces/knots) yields statistical identifiability from extant timetree data, whereas smoothly varying rate models are nonidentifiable; the pulled speciation rate λp fully determines the branching-time distribution and is consistently estimable as tree size increases.",
  "When speciation and extinction rates are allowed to vary through time on extant timetrees, traditional parameters (speciation, extinction, net diversification) become unidentifiable; reparameterizing to pulled rates yields identifiable summaries of the LTT that remove the unidentifiability, and the paper also notes (by analogy) that informative priors can address unidentifiability in related inference problems.",
  "The paper establishes that time‑dependent FBD models are identifiable when sampled lineages remain in the process (r=0) and sampling rates are positive, highlights that identifiability fails when removal upon sampling is enforced (r=1) or when an additional unknown removal parameter is introduced, and emphasizes that including fossils as sampled ancestors is key to identifiability.",
  "- Arbitrary time-varying generalized birth–death processes are non-identifiable from extant-only phylogenies, but imposing piecewise-constant or piecewise-polynomial rate functions restores identifiability, and adding fossil sampling through time can also render the model identifiable.",
  "In extant-only time-varying birth–death models, identifiability issues persist regardless of data size; models within a congruence class are equally likely, while reparameterization to pulled diversification rates yields identifiable quantities though with interpretation challenges.",
  "For extant timetrees, the likelihood is fully determined by the pulled speciation (birth) rate; restricting to piecewise-constant rates yields provable identifiability when the number of sampled tips exceeds a bound proportional to the number of pieces (n>8K with fixed sampling fraction), and identifiability is conjectured to extend to piecewise-polynomial rates with n>8K(1+d).",
  "For LC–MS/MS identification of disulfide-linked peptides, calculate the theoretical mass of a disulfide-bonded species as the sum of the two cysteine-containing peptide masses minus 2 Da (loss of two hydrogens upon disulfide formation); ETD preferentially cleaves disulfide bonds whereas CID typically leaves them intact, providing complementary confirmation strategies.",
  "ETD/EThcD MS methods enable direct identification of disulfide linkages by preferentially cleaving S–S bonds to produce two intense disulfide-cleaved peptide ions, while trypsin digestion at neutral pH can cause disulfide reshuffling; conversely, pepsin digestion under acidic conditions prevents reshuffling and yields more authentic Cys–Cys bond detections.",
  "This protocol outlines a non-reducing LC–MS strategy that prevents disulﬁde scrambling with N-ethylmaleimide and acidic conditions, leverages protease digestion (including trypsin), and uses pLink-SS with HCD spectra to identify disulﬁde-linked peptides—an approach explicitly recommended for comprehensive disulﬁde mapping in puriﬁed therapeutic proteins.",
  "ETD-based LC-MS enables direct confirmation of disulfide linkages in tryptic digests by preferentially cleaving disulfide bonds and producing disulfide-dissociated peptides (either directly or via charge-reduced species), with precursor ions above ~m/z 900 often yielding dominant charge-reduced species that require MS3 to reveal the dissociated peptides.",
  "LC-MS workflows for disulfide mapping use tryptic digestion to produce disulfide-linked peptides, screen precursor m/z values (across charge states) for candidate cysteine-containing peptide pairs, and then validate linkages by combining ETD—which preferentially cleaves disulfides yielding high-abundance dissociated peptide ions—with CID backbone fragmentation, while accounting for potential miscleavages due to steric hindrance near disulfide bonds.",
  "Mass spectrometers quantify ions by their mass-to-charge (m/z), with quadrupole mass filters transmitting only selected m/z windows and Orbitrap analyzers detecting all m/z species in parallel by measuring axial oscillation frequencies and converting them via Fourier transformation to high-resolution m/z spectra.",
  "The study identifies disulfide-linked tryptic peptides by calculating theoretical precursor m/z values for candidate disulfide pairs, matching observed MS1 monoisotopic m/z and charge states to these predictions, and verifying with MS2 fragmentation; such peptides commonly appear across multiple charge states (+2 to +9), so multiple m/z values can indicate the same disulfide-linked peptide pair.",
  "Enrichment steps that include an initial incubation at 37°C followed by incubation at approximately 41.5–43°C under microaerobic conditions can resuscitate damaged or VBNC Campylobacter cells and significantly improve recovery prior to selective plating.",
  "Enrichment culture (using a selective Preston enrichment broth followed by subculture) recovered Campylobacter from all known-positive faecal specimens, including those negative by direct plating, and yielded subculture plates with fewer contaminants, addressing problems like swarming Bacillus overgrowth seen on less-selective media.",
  "Campylobacter jejuni remains recoverable from poultry after cold stress: refrigeration for 3–7 days causes only small declines in viable counts, and freezing at −20°C (with or without prior refrigeration) still allows recovery on all sampling days from both chicken skin and ground chicken, demonstrating sustained viability under typical cold-storage conditions.",
  "The study shows that no single selective medium recovers all Campylobacter strains on primary plating; using at least two selective agars (with Preston medium included) improves isolation, and Campylobacter colonies can be obscured at 48 hours by overgrowth from swarming Proteus or Bacillus on some media.",
  "Campylobacter jejuni is microaerophilic (requiring 3–15% O2) and is highly vulnerable to atmospheric oxygen; oxidative stress can push cells into a viable-but-non-culturable state, yet relieving the inducing stress can allow resuscitation and renewed growth.",
  "For optimal Campylobacter recovery from stool, laboratories should process specimens within 2 hours (or use Cary-Blair at 4°C if delayed), incubate selective media under microaerobic conditions at 42°C for at least 48 hours, and consider using a combination of selective media including a charcoal-based medium to increase yield by 10–15%.",
  "In MPN testing, designs often include multiple replicate tubes per dilution (e.g., 3, 5, 8, or 10), and because any inoculated tube or plate with at least one viable organism will show detectable growth, using more replicates provides more opportunities for detecting low concentrations of a target microbe, while insufficient colony selection during confirmation can lead to overlooking the organism.",
  "Using freshly prepared Campylobacter media/plates and ensuring plates are properly dried (without over-drying the surface) are emphasized by the FDA BAM because media absorb oxygen during storage and even brief surface drying inhibits Campylobacter growth, both of which can reduce recovery.",
  "Extending primary isolation plate incubation to 72 hours under microaerophilic conditions at 42–43°C increased recovery of Campylobacter jejuni by approximately 9% compared with shorter incubation intervals.",
  "In Diels–Alder biaryl formation using nitrophenyl acetylenes and oxygenated cyclohexadienes, a [2.2.2] bicyclic intermediate undergoes [4+2] cycloreversion that extrudes ethylene as the small molecule byproduct, and reactions can be performed neat at elevated temperature.",
  "The supporting information documents biaryl synthesis via a Diels–Alder approach and explicitly labels products such as “TSOMe Br/C02Et Biaryl” and “TSOBn Br/C02Et Trisub biaryl,” confirming the generation of biaryl frameworks in the reported examples.",
  "The supporting information documents NMR data for cyclohexa-1,4-diene carboxylate intermediates (6a–f) and biphenyl-1-carboxylate products (7a–f), illustrating a high-pressure Diels–Alder strategy to form biaryls in the context of cannabinol synthesis.",
  "The review emphasizes that Diels–Alder reactions typically proceed under simple thermal conditions (heating a conjugated diene with an electron-withdrawing dienophile) and, in certain intramolecular cases, the cycloaddition can be followed by re-aromatization accompanied by the loss of a small molecule such as CO2.",
  "rDA steps documented in the review can furnish aromatized products (e.g., benzene, substituted phenanthrenes/isobenzofurans) and can proceed with concurrent extrusion of small molecules such as CO2 under thermolysis.",
  "Inverse electron-demand Diels−Alder reactions of alkynes with electron-deficient dienes such as cyclopentadienone and ortho-benzoquinone can be strongly accelerated by secondary orbital interactions involving the alkyne HOMO-1 and the diene LUMO, beyond primary HOMO–LUMO considerations.",
  "Spectrum labels in the ESI explicitly indicate phenol or methoxy/phenol components in mixtures annotated as “TSNMe2 Cl/CPh2OH phenol” and “TSOMe Cl/CPh2OH MeO/OH,” providing direct evidence of identifiable small-molecule components accompanying biaryl-forming reaction systems.",
  "- LiAlH4 in ether at room temperature concurrently reduces a disulfide and cleaves an acetate in an acetal-protected 2-thioglyceraldehyde precursor, yielding 2-thioglyceraldehyde diethyl acetal (3,3-diethoxy-2-mercaptopropan-1-ol, 17).",
  "The review documents a general sequence where monoterpene epoxides are converted to thiiranes using the N,N-dimethylthioformamide–TFA system, and subsequent LiAlH4 reduction of these thiiranes yields monoterpene thiols; exemplar cases produce 1-p-menthene-8-thiol or 1-p-menthene-4-thiol depending on the epoxide substrate.",
  "The paper details a workflow in which olefins are first epoxidized with m-CPBA in DCM at 0 °C and then converted under Brønsted acid catalysis to thiiranes (episulfides), explicitly referring to the isolated products as “thiirane” products.",
  "Epoxides can be converted to thiiranes (episulfides) via oxygen-to-sulfur exchange under non-aqueous conditions; catalytic Bi(TFA)3 or Bi(OTf)3 enables high-yield reactions in acetonitrile reflux using ammonium thiocyanate or thiourea across diverse epoxide substrates.",
  "This study demonstrates that limonene 1,2-epoxides can be converted to 1,2-episulfides using the DMTF/TFA system, and subsequent LiAlH4 reduction of the 1,2-episulfide 2a yields 2-mercapto-p-menth-8-ene (compound 3) as the main isolable product.",
  "The study shows that Venturello-catalyzed epoxidations of terpene alkenes proceed with selectivity similar to stoichiometric peracids and, in the case of γ-terpinene, yield a cis-bis-epoxide in high yield and diastereoselectivity due to a directed second epoxidation by the initially introduced epoxide oxygen; terpinolene is noted as a common terpene in turpentine feedstocks.",
  "The review highlights that peracid-based Prilezhaev epoxidation (using agents such as m-CPBA) is a common alkene epoxidation method but generates acidic conditions that are unsuitable for acid-sensitive terpene epoxides, which can undergo acid-promoted hydrolysis (e.g., limonene-1,2-epoxide forming limonene-1,2-diol).",
  "In terpene epoxidation, peracids like m-CPBA can effect epoxidation without a catalyst but their acidity complicates selectivity; for monoterpenes such as limonene, the more substituted double bond epoxidizes more readily, typically affording the 1,2-epoxide preferentially over other positions.",
  "In rats, longer-chain aliphatic odorants produce systematic chemotopic shifts of glomerular activation toward more rostral (anterior) and ventral (inferior) regions of functional-group-specific domains across multiple straight-chained odorant classes.",
  "In rats glomeruli responsive to aliphatic aldehydes form a systematic map where preferred carbon chain length rises from the middle of the bulb toward anterior rostral and lateral positions with the longest chain responses near the lateral edge over roughly 1.5 mm and the maps are mirror symmetric across bulbs.",
  "Within Cluster A of the rat olfactory bulb, aliphatic acid chain length is topographically mapped such that short-chain-responsive glomeruli (A-3), which include posteriorly located sites that also respond to diketones, give way along a gradual spatial gradient to long-chain-responsive glomeruli (A-1), indicating an orderly positional shift from A-3 (short) through A-2 (middle) to A-1 (long).",
  "Across multiple functional modules in the rat olfactory bulb, increasing odorant carbon number consistently shifts glomerular activation ventrally (inferiorly), with documented ventral progressions for carboxylic acids, ethyl esters, alcohols, and aldehydes.",
  "In rat dorsal olfactory bulb cluster A, aliphatic acids are mapped by carbon chain length such that activation shifts from subcluster A-3 to A-1 as carbon number increases; subcluster A-3 corresponds to the most posterior portion of cluster A (indexed by its strong responsiveness to diketones), establishing a posterior (short-chain) to anterior (long-chain) gradient within this cluster.",
  "In the rat olfactory bulb’s ventrolateral zones, glomeruli preferring longer carbon-chain odorants (across aliphatic aldehydes, ketones, and ethers) are concentrated anteroventrally in Cluster I, whereas shorter-chain hydrocarbons preferentially engage Cluster H located more posterocentrally/posterodorsally.",
  "In the mouse olfactory bulb’s DI domain (cluster A), short-chain aliphatic acids preferentially activate posterior glomeruli while anterior regions respond across tested chain lengths, and the overall spatial arrangement of molecular feature clusters is conserved between rats and mice.",
  "In Rhodopseudomonas palustris, the couAB operon encodes enzymes (CouB, a CoA ligase, and CouA, an enoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase) that catalyze conversion of p-coumarate to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and acetyl-CoA; deletion of couA or couB causes very slow growth on p-coumarate, indicating these genes are major contributors to p-coumarate degradation.",
  "Corynebacterium glutamicum degrades phenylpropanoids via the phd gene cluster; deleting phenylpropanoid catabolic genes (e.g., in the DelAro5 background unable to catabolize aromatics) prevents degradation and enabled para-coumarate accumulation when tyrosine ammonia-lyase was expressed.",
  "Corynebacterium glutamicum degrades phenylpropanoids (including p-coumaric acid) via the Phd pathway; genes cg0341, cg0344, cg0345, and cg0347 are essential for this degradation, and deletion of the cg0344–47 cluster abolishes utilization of phenylpropanoids as sole carbon sources, while deletion of the transporter PhdT (cg0340) only reduces growth rate.",
  "In Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, the cou gene cluster degrades p-hydroxycinnamates, with CouL functioning as a p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA synthetase that catalyzes the initial CoA thioesterification step; deletion of couL abolishes growth on p-hydroxycinnamates, demonstrating its essential role in their catabolism.",
  "In Acinetobacter sp. ADP1, the hcaC gene encodes a hydroxycinnamate:CoA ligase that catalyzes the initial activation step in the dissimilation of hydroxycinnamates, acting directly on caffeate, p-coumarate, and ferulate.",
  "In Corynebacterium glutamicum the phenylpropanoid degradation pathway requires the phd gene cluster; PhdA (acyl:CoA ligase) converts p‑coumaric acid to p‑coumaroyl‑CoA, and deleting phdA prevented CoA activation and increased p‑coumaric acid titers, indicating reduced product consumption via the degradation route.",
  "In wind-tunnel experiments, moth upwind orientation depends on optomotor anemotaxis: moving floor patterns in the same direction as the airflow make males increase speed, opposite motion reduces ground speed or can cause downwind drift, and without added visual cues moths rarely navigate successfully; typical ground speeds during plume tracking are around 4–5 m/min but vary widely.",
  "In Drosophila free-flight experiments, high visual contrast leads to regulated forward speed around 0.15 m/s with lower variability, whereas reducing contrast increases both mean speed and variability; experimental visual stimuli are delivered in the blue–green range.",
  "Honeybees estimate travel distance by integrating optic flow (apparent image motion) from the environment; this visually driven odometer operates accurately under headwinds and tailwinds and does not rely on time-of-flight, wingbeat counts, or energy expenditure.",
  "In a tunnel, reducing horizontal optic flow cues causes nocturnal Megalopta bees to increase groundspeed, while their lateral centering remains unchanged; this aligns with the general principle that minimizing horizontal optic flow elevates speed, and highlights species-specific differences in how optic flow influences centering.",
  "The study demonstrates that honeybee distance estimation is driven by optic flow integrated over time; even when optic flow is limited to the floor, the odometric signal remains strong (~70% of full-cue conditions), and experimentally moving the background pattern against flight direction further increases the integrated optic flow and the perceived distance.",
  "In honeybees, brood pheromone exposure alone lowers worker vitellogenin levels and is associated with poorer long-term colony survival, whereas absence of both brood and its pheromone yields higher vitellogenin and better survival outcomes.",
  "Insects navigating to odor sources combine detection of the attractive odor with wind-direction sensing, and use visual ground-image motion to maintain an upwind course (optomotor anemotaxis), with responses occurring on millisecond timescales that allow rapid reactions to changing plume structure.",
  "In a wind tunnel, Drosophila exhibit upwind anemotaxis that is strengthened by attractive odor: contact with a narrow odor plume produces a rapid upwind surge (reduced crosswind velocity and increased upwind speed), and continuous homogeneous odor leads to very straight, predominantly upwind flight.",
  "Cuttlefish camouflage is driven by visual scene properties: uniform backgrounds evoke uniform body patterns, while disruptive patterns require high-contrast, well-defined edges and one or a few light objects sized comparably to the animals’ White square component; dark objects alone do not elicit disruptive patterns.",
  "In wind-tunnel assays with male H. virescens, each pheromone-triggered upwind flight surge is a repeatable unit lasting about 0.38 s and advancing roughly 13.4 cm, initiated after ~0.30 s from filament contact; when filament contacts cease, casting begins after ~0.30 s.",
  "Brown-Sequard syndrome involves a hemisection of the spinal cord (often from knife wounds) producing ipsilateral loss of motor control, proprioception, and vibration with contralateral loss of pain and temperature below the lesion; in the ASIA dermatome map, T10 corresponds to the umbilicus.",
  "Brown-Séquard syndrome presents with ipsilateral motor and proprioceptive loss and contralateral pain/temperature deficits due to spinal cord hemisection; this case documents a T8-level thoracic hemicord injury with right-sided involvement on MRI consistent with BSS.",
  "In Brown-Séquard syndrome, a hemicord lesion causes ipsilateral motor and dorsal column (vibration/proprioception) loss with contralateral pain/temperature loss that begins about 2–3 segments below the lesion due to the spinothalamic tract crossing a couple of levels above the afferent entry.",
  "Brown-Sequard syndrome produces ipsilateral motor/proprioception/vibration loss with contralateral pain/temperature loss, and the ISNCSCI dermatome map identifies T10 at the umbilicus, allowing localization of hemisection injuries when sensory changes begin at the umbilicus.",
  "Brown-Sequard syndrome arises from hemisection of the spinal cord, producing ipsilateral weakness and loss of proprioception/vibration (due to corticospinal decussation in the medulla and ipsilateral ascent of dorsal columns) and contralateral loss of pain/temperature (due to spinothalamic fibers crossing a few segments above entry and ascending contralaterally).",
  "ANGSD highlights that neutrality statistics such as θ and Tajima’s D should be estimated using genotype likelihood-based methods that incorporate genotype uncertainty, because analyses based on called genotypes—especially at low or medium coverage—can introduce errors or biases; moreover, site frequency spectrum estimates and inferred variability are highly sensitive to modeling choices.",
  "The paper provides a unified framework showing that generalized Watterson estimators for NGS data are unbiased when missing data are modeled via effective read depth (r = 0 for missing, r = ∞ for present), and cautions that SNP ascertainment can bias variability estimates, while noting Π is inconsistent for θ.",
  "Under the neutral model, nucleotide diversity can be quantified as the average pairwise nucleotide differences (k) or as heterozygosity (H); k directly measures the extent of sequence differences, and, among common summaries, the count of segregating sites yields the lowest-variance estimator of the population mutation parameter M.",
  "Under the neutral infinite-sites model, Watterson’s S-based measure (corrected by a1) and nucleotide diversity (π) both estimate M=4Nu in expectation, but S intrinsically depends on sample size and ignores allele frequencies, whereas π reflects allele frequencies; this distinction underlies Tajima’s D, which compares the two estimates to test neutrality.",
  "Assuming missing genotypes or omitted sites are homozygous for the reference allele (a common practice with variants-only VCFs) produces downwardly biased estimates of π, with the magnitude of bias increasing in direct proportion to the amount of missing data; unbiased estimation requires excluding missing data from both numerators and denominators and adjusting effective sequence length rather than treating them as invariant.",
  "Filtering and conditioning choices (e.g., restricting to biallelic sites versus single-mutation SNPs) change the expected site frequency spectrum, and misapplying a single-mutation SNP model to biallelic data leads to substantial underestimation of θ, demonstrating that data filtering alone can bias parameter estimates without violating the standard neutral model.",
  "The paper states that when genotype-call uncertainty is ignored, allele-frequency estimates become biased, which propagates to biased results in common population-genetic analyses (including variability assessments); it illustrates SFS distortion (e.g., overestimation of singletons) and describes approaches that aggregate over genotype/allele-frequency posteriors to mitigate such biases.",
  "Reference bias during read mapping can miss alternative alleles and convert heterozygous sites to reference homozygotes, which is known to affect estimates of heterozygosity and allele frequencies and can slightly skew genome-wide population genetic estimates.",
  "Nei and Li (1979) define nucleotide diversity as the average number of nucleotide differences per site between two randomly chosen sequences and provide an estimator using the average proportion of shared restriction sites, with ir estimated as * = (−ln S)/r, where S is the average shared-site proportion and r is the recognition sequence length.",
  "Simulations across multiple sequencing designs showed systematic underestimation of both the number of segregating sites (basis for Watterson’s θ) and expected heterozygosity (related to π), with underestimation driven by low depth (missing alternate alleles in heterozygotes) and small sample size (heterozygotes not sampled), while large sample sizes with low per-sample depth (around 2X) improved accuracy.",
  "Empirical exome analyses and simulations show that increasing sample size inflates Watterson’s θ by revealing more low-frequency variants, whereas nucleotide diversity π remains unchanged with sample size and is robust to both demographic growth and purifying selection.",
  "The basic Wright–Fisher framework analyzed assumes a neutral, diploid population with discrete non-overlapping generations and random sampling of alleles from randomly chosen parents (random mating), with no selection or mutation, and it connects the discrete model to a diffusion approximation by considering the limit as population size tends to infinity.",
  "The paper explicitly analyzes random mating populations without selection, assuming autosomal and unlinked genes, and presents results for very large populations, providing a framework consistent with scenarios of infinite, randomly mating populations without selective differences.",
  "The provided excerpt contains only a bibliographic/reproduction notice (Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. 52, pp. 399–433, 1918) and no substantive scientific content relevant to population genetics or quantitative traits.",
  "Heritability estimates and variance components are spatiotemporally local properties that depend on the current distributions of genotypes and environments; even traits with high heritability can be substantially changed by environmental differences, and group comparisons of phenotypes reflect both historical genotype frequencies and present environmental structures rather than pure functional causation.",
  "The editorial highlights that speciation generally involves the evolution of reproductive isolation—sometimes evolving faster than morphological change—and documents mechanisms including identified speciation genes and ecological adaptations (e.g., salinity) that can produce incipient isolation via reduced hybrid survival.",
  "Kimura (1969) argues that many amino acid substitutions are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and fixed by random drift, leading to a roughly constant molecular substitution rate; for neutral mutations, the substitution rate equals the mutation rate, and the expected fixation time is about 4Ne generations, while acknowledging that adaptive changes by selection still occur.",
  "Across 35 studies (32 species; 1032 comparisons), local genotypes often outperformed foreign ones at their home sites (71% of site-level comparisons), strict reciprocal evidence of local adaptation occurred in 45.3% of pairs, and the magnitude of local adaptation showed no significant association with geographic distance ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers.",
  "The study demonstrates that in annual killifish, strong environmental selection associated with ephemeral aquatic habitats can drive embryonic developmental divergence (e.g., diapause vs. direct development) even during the typically conserved phylotypic period.",
  "The paper emphasizes that predicting whether populations will or will not complete speciation is inherently uncertain: hybrid zones can persist indefinitely, shift toward greater isolation, or even collapse, and terms like ‘incipient speciation’ are discouraged because they presume knowledge of future outcomes.",
  "In Nothobranchius annual killifishes, geographic isolation of ephemeral pools has produced deeply genetically structured populations, the major clades are nearly allopatric implying geography-driven speciation, and aridity gradients across their range are associated with differences in captive lifespan, indicating spatial variation in quantitative aging-related phenotypes.",
  "Speciation without physical barriers to gene flow requires strong divergent selection; under neutrality, gene flow tends to homogenize adjacent populations, and while migration and drift act genome-wide, selection maintains divergence only in genomic regions affecting selected traits.",
  "Heritability (h2/H2) is a population- and environment-specific ratio of genetic to phenotypic variance; it does not inform about or predict mean differences between groups, and high heritability within a population cannot be used to attribute between-group differences to genetic causes.",
  "In subtractive color mixing of paints, blue and yellow typically produce green, and red with yellow is expected to yield orange, whereas additive mixing of blue and yellow light tends to produce white or neutral gray.",
  "Human color perception arises from combinations of cone responses (additive color mixing), allowing the same hue (e.g., yellow) to be perceived from different spectral combinations, while an object's true color depends on its absorption/reflectance and its apparent color can vary with illumination.",
  "Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary hues; warm colors span hues from red to yellow (with orange shown as a warm example), whereas blue is depicted as a cool color.",
  "This study shows that laccase can decolorize the blue dye indigo carmine by eliminating its 610 nm chromophore band and producing isatin sulfonic acid; a D501G Bacillus amyloliquefaciens laccase variant achieves >92% decolorization in 5 h at pH 9.0 without mediators.",
  "Indigo Carmine (a blue dye) undergoes laccase/TEMPO/O2-mediated degradation that visibly shifts solution color from blue to pale-yellow and ultimately to colorless; HPLC confirms formation of isatin-5-sulfonic acid, 4-sulfo-3-anthranilic acid, and anthranilic acid as key products alongside disappearance of the Indigo Carmine peak.",
  "Enzyme defects in a sequential metabolic pathway can cause accumulation of substrates or intermediates before the blocked step, deficiency of products after the block, or rerouting of substrate flux into alternative pathways; restoring pathway homeostasis can be therapeutic.",
  "Beadle and Tatum showed that x-ray–induced mutations in Neurospora can inactivate single genes that control specific enzymatic steps in metabolic pathways; such blocks cause growth defects on minimal media but can be bypassed by providing the missing pathway product, supporting a one gene–one enzyme model of biochemical control.",

  "Humans can detect infrasound at sufficiently high levels using the ears as the primary sensing organ, with vibrotactile sensations emerging only at levels roughly 20–25 dB above the auditory threshold.",
  "Many laboratory mammals can detect ultrasonic frequencies well above the human upper limit (~17.6–20 kHz), with reported 60-dB upper limits ranging up to ~85.5 kHz in mice, indicating that sounds inaudible to humans can be audible to other animals.",
  "Fin whale vocal behavior includes a dominant ‘20 Hz’ pulse composed of ~1 s pulses spanning roughly 42–18 Hz, sometimes accompanied by a lower-frequency ‘backbeat’ (23–13 Hz), with additional less common call types such as a ‘40 Hz’ pulse and higher-frequency components.",
  "Human skeletal muscles emit low-frequency (~25 Hz) sounds at about 60–70 dB SPL during sustained contraction; these are generally inaudible to unaided humans at 25 Hz and transmit poorly through air but couple effectively through water.",
  "For humans with normal hearing under free-field conditions, equal-loudness contours (ISO 226:2003) span 20–12,500 Hz, and perceived loudness at the same A-weighted level varies substantially with spectral bandwidth and low-frequency content.",
  "The study shows that New Zealand blue whale songs are very low-frequency signals, generally under 100 Hz, with prominent components near 24 Hz (units B and C) and 18 Hz (unit D), confirming the low-frequency nature of blue whale vocalizations in this region.",
  "Behavioral audiograms show big brown bats hear exceptionally high frequencies with very low thresholds (best threshold 7 dB SPL at 20 kHz), a 60-dB hearing range of ~3.7–104 kHz, and upper sensitivity extending to 120 kHz, indicating strong capability to detect faint, high-frequency airborne sounds.",
  "Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) detect sounds up to approximately 5 kHz but do not detect ultrasonic frequencies (greater than 20 kHz), showing neither evoked potential nor behavioral responses even when exposed to high-level ultrasonic stimuli up to 185 dB re 1 mPa.",
  "Fin whales commonly produce low-frequency 20-Hz pulses (approximately 28–15 Hz, ~1 s duration) that are recorded worldwide, and in Antarctic waters these pulses are often accompanied by a higher-frequency component around 85–89 Hz.",
  "Skeletal muscle contractions generate mechanical vibrations and associated acoustic signals (phonomyography/acoustic myography) that predominantly occupy low frequencies below 100 Hz, commonly spanning approximately 2–100 Hz.",
  "The paper establishes that infrasound below 20 Hz remains audible to humans at sufficient levels (with thresholds measured down to 1.5 Hz) and concludes that the ear is the most sensitive receptor for such low-frequency sound, with no evidence that sub-threshold infrasound is perceived through other receptors.",

  "MHC class I is broadly expressed by nearly all cell types and presents cytosolic peptides; in engineered T cells, enhanced uptake via TIM-4 CER enables cross-presentation through HLA class I to activate antigen-specific T cells.",
  "MHC class II expression is mainly restricted to professional APCs, but non-APCs (including epithelial cells) can constitutively express it in certain contexts, and other cell types can be induced to express MHC II by IFN-γ, supporting strategies to enable MHC II–dependent antigen presentation by T cells.",
  "The paper states that the class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) promotes microglial endocytosis (engulfment) of fibrillar β-amyloid, whereas CD36, also expressed on microglia, is implicated primarily in proinflammatory signaling responses to fibrillar β-amyloid.",
  "The paper reports that microglial class A scavenger receptors promote endocytosis of fibrillar β-amyloid, while CD36 is identified as a receptor that confers specific binding to fibrillar β-amyloid and signals ROS production; loss of SR-A reduces endocytosis/binding of fibrillar β-amyloid by approximately 60%.",
  "The study shows COLVI helically wraps AL59 amyloid fibrils and notes prior evidence that collagens—especially types I and IV—protect AL amyloid from phagocytic clearance, indicating collagen-amyloid interactions can impede macrophage recognition and removal.",
  "Collagen XVIII, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that localizes to classic senile plaques and amyloid-laden vessels in Alzheimer’s disease, can be proteolytically cleaved to produce endostatin; more broadly, HSPGs promote A\u0001 fibrillization and stabilize A\u0001 fibrils, thereby inhibiting their proteolytic breakdown.",
  "Under near-physiological conditions (pH 6.4; 37–40 °C), β2-microglobulin formed amyloid fibrils only when a fibrillar collagen surface or an immobilized positively charged surface (poly-L-lysine-coated mica) was present; without such surfaces, no fibrils were obtained, indicating that collagen’s positively charged interface catalyzes localized fibrillogenesis.",

  "Under maximum parsimony, the best tree is the one with the minimal parsimony score; scores can be computed efficiently with the Fitch algorithm when character-state changes have equal costs, while with non-uniform cost matrices the parsimony score is not conveniently interpretable as a minimum number of substitutions.",
  "The paper defines characters as independent variables with mutually exclusive states and distinguishes neomorphic (presence/absence) from transformational characters; it recommends contingent coding that separates presence–absence from variation and marks inapplicable states with “?”, stating that “absent” should be used only in neomorphic character statements.",
  "The paper argues that many morphological characters reflect continuous quantitative variation and should be coded accordingly; it justifies ordering states for such traits and introduces step-matrix gap-weighting to assign costs proportional to differences in mean species values, enabling more explicit and parsimonious treatment of morphological data.",
  "TNT supports parsimony analyses of discrete morphological datasets under equal weights by default and, for small datasets, can guarantee recovery of all most-parsimonious trees using branch-and-bound, with options to diagnose character changes (gains/losses) via synapomorphy mapping.",
  "Under parsimony, TNT v1.5 evaluates trees by reconstructing ancestral conditions that minimize total differences across branches and supports integrating geometric morphometric landmarks with standard discrete/continuous morphological characters within a single matrix for phylogenetic analysis.",
  "Parsimony analysis evaluates candidate phylogenies by counting character-state changes and selecting the shortest trees; in practice this uses heuristic branch-swapping and can be made more efficient by exact methods like indirect tree-length calculation based on final state sets and by collapsing zero-length branches to polytomies before tree comparison.",
  "The paper emphasizes that because phylogenetic tree search is NP-complete and tree space grows exponentially, effective analyses rely on heuristic combinations—e.g., Wagner addition plus TBR swapping, sectorial searches, ratcheting/drifting, and tree fusing—with the parsimony ratchet specifically highlighted as improving escape from local optima compared to repeated Wagner+TBR alone.",
  "Including a wide range of morphological characters—rather than excluding them for missing data or perceived homoplasy—tends to increase phylogenetic accuracy, as simulation and congruence studies show that many common exclusion criteria are unsupported and can discard useful information.",
  "A morphological parsimony approach that handles inapplicable data distinguishes tree length (number of transformations) from a broader tree score that adds penalties for extra applicable regions; this framework, together with careful coding of dependent characters (e.g., choosing between additive binary and reductive strategies), avoids spurious step counts and better reflects homology/homoplasy patterns in morphological phylogenies.",
  "In container habitats, predatory copepods are identified as the most effective invertebrate agents against mosquitoes and can reduce Aedes larvae by 90–100% in field settings, but their mosquito-killing activity is diminished in larger containers.",
  "Field surveys in central Uganda found that permanent habitats (ponds, streams) supported high predator diversity and few Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae (37.5% of pond quadrats; <1% in streams), whereas An. gambiae s.l. were most common in temporary pools and roadside ditches.",
  "Across western Kenya sites, Anopheles larvae were more likely in man-made water bodies and especially abundant in habitats with grassy vegetation; both permanent and temporary waters supported An. gambiae breeding.",
  "In Aedes aegypti container habitats, larger-volume and stable water-holding sites produce higher pupal yields than smaller or unstable sites, with the size/stability effect most pronounced in dry seasons when rain refilling is infrequent.",
  "In newly created ponds, colonization occurs within the first month; early conditions (low macrophyte cover, absence of fish predators) favor short‑generation invertebrates, and across subsequent seasons overall taxon richness and abundance increase as succession progresses.",
  "Field data show that immature Aedes aegypti abundance increases with container water volume and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and that larger containers are recognized cues for oviposition, indicating that bigger, unmanaged artificial water bodies tend to produce higher numbers of immatures.",
  "In laboratory Aedes aegypti, larger rearing containers increase larval development time and, under high larval density (1.4 larvae/ml), produce significantly lower productivity than small/medium containers; larvae predominantly occupy container edges (~76%) regardless of container size.",
  "In an Argentine neighborhood with sustained control efforts, large water-storage containers (tanks/drums) consistently produced the majority of Aedes aegypti pupae (≈65–84%), and among infested containers, pupal output was most strongly linked to container type—especially large tanks—and the presence of rain water.",
  "In the Ghibe River Basin study, Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae were most abundant in small, sunlit habitats lacking emergent plants and surrounding vegetation; emergent vegetation and temperature were key predictors of overall Anopheles larval density, while water depth showed no significant association.",
  "Ae. albopictus typically uses small containers whereas Cx. pipiens favors larger water bodies; where both species share larval habitats, competition is asymmetric and can markedly reduce Cx. pipiens abundance (up to ~70%), particularly aligning with conditions that promote higher Ae. albopictus densities.",
  "Across Kenyan rural and urban sites, Aedes aegypti breeding was predominantly in outdoor man-made containers, with productivity shaped by water permanence (large volumes retained for long periods that allow full larval development), frequency of water replenishment, sunlight exposure, and whether containers were covered.",
  "In African Anopheles systems, stable and larger aquatic habitats (e.g., ponds and streams) typically harbor more and diverse macroinvertebrate predators, while Anopheles gambiae s.l. are particularly abundant in small, temporary pools with fewer predators; predator presence can also reduce oviposition in conditioned water.",
  "Across studies, constructed wetlands commonly exhibited increased mosquito abundance—particularly immediately after construction—whereas non-constructed wetlands more often showed decreases; older constructed wetlands did not have higher mosquito numbers than natural wetlands, and early increases have been linked to initial absence of predators and competitors.",
  "Field experiments in Thailand showed that Aedes aegypti oviposited far more in larger containers, with container volume being the strongest predictor of egg numbers (88% of between-container variation), followed by water surface area (85%) and opening diameter (83%), indicating oviposition preference increases with container size.",
  "In field mesocosms, mosquito larvae were more abundant in shaded and predator-excluding (closed) containers, whereas open sunlit containers were colonized by Bradinopyga strachani whose presence clearly reduced mosquito larval density; additionally, an older irrigation pond with established dragonfly breeding had no mosquito larvae recorded.",
  "In this study, oriented navigation was elicited by placing flies on an air-cushioned spherical treadmill within a closed-loop virtual-reality arena featuring a single bright vertical bar as a head-direction cue; under these conditions flies commonly maintained straight, goal-directed headings, enabling analysis of steering responses to controlled visual perturbations.",
  "Menotaxis in Drosophila can be elicited by presenting an artificially generated “sun” in a virtual flight arena, and this heading-choice behavior depends on compass neurons in the central complex.",
  "This study analyzed walking behavior in D. melanogaster using circular arenas and an L-shaped labyrinth, and in tethered conditions elicited walking by allowing flies to grasp a small Styrofoam ball; no specific menotaxis-induction protocol was described.",
  "The commentary emphasizes that fly saccades are visually initiated and describes experimental paradigms—such as tethered preparations with circular visual displays—in which flies’ head and body movements are analyzed in response to wide-field visual stimuli.",
  "Menotaxis in Drosophila melanogaster is elicited by celestial stimuli: flies adopt and maintain arbitrary headings relative to either a pattern of linearly polarized light or a simulated sun (small bright spot).",
  "Orientation behavior in this study was induced by delivering a food odor (pentanoic acid) or water vapor via a nozzle at calibrated flow rates to tethered flies walking on an air-supported spherical treadmill, and flies oriented toward the odor source.",
  "In tethered walking experiments, food-deprived Drosophila heated to 34°C and presented with a bright vertical bar in closed-loop maintained a stable angular bearing relative to the landmark, a behavior the authors relate to menotaxis.",
  "In this study, head-fixed Drosophila walked on an air-supported ball while viewing horizontally rotating vertical bar patterns (1 Hz) in an LED arena, which reliably induced optomotor turning responses used to correlate behavior with neural activity.",
  "Drosophila orientation behavior can be induced and quantified by presenting linearly polarized light from above in a circular arena while rotating the polarizer in 45° steps; flies align their body axis parallel to the e-vector under both dorsal and ventral stimulation, with responses abolished by darkness or depolarization.",
  "The study used a broad visual stimulus panel—including looming/drifting objects, large-field optic flow, and a rotating polarized UV light—and found that horizontal motion and regressive optic flow were particularly effective at eliciting flight-gated responses in the fan-shaped body that are important for controlling azimuthal flight heading.",
  "In this study, Drosophila orientation behavior is elicited in Buridan’s paradigm by placing two inaccessible visual targets (black vertical stripes) on opposite sides of a homogeneously illuminated arena; these targets alter walking orientation while leaving overall activity largely unchanged.",

  "This study identifies ASJ as one of eight amphid neurons with simple rod-like ‘channel’ cilia and reports vesicles between flared doublet microtubules at the ASJ ciliary base; it characterizes ciliary ultrastructure but does not provide synaptic connectivity or axonal projection targets.",
  "In the adult C. elegans tail, sensory outputs predominantly converge onto the major interneurons AVA, AVD, and PVC, with PHB sensory neurons forming especially frequent dyadic synapses onto AVA and PVC.",
  "In the adult C. elegans connectome, amphid sensory neurons (including chemosensory, odorsensory, and thermosensory modalities; SN6) predominantly project to layer 3 interneurons (IN3), and synaptic strengths are quantified in adjacency matrices that sum synapse sizes across pairs of cells.",

  "The study provides a self-consistent C. elegans wiring diagram with adjacency matrices where each entry records the number of synaptic contacts from one neuron to another, and makes the dataset publicly available, enabling identification of a neuron's main projection target by synapse number.",
  "ASJ does not synapse onto the usual amphid-associated interneurons (AIA, AIB, AIY, AIZ) but instead synapses onto the PVQ interneuron; PVQ then connects to AIA, providing an indirect path from ASJ to the major amphid interneuron set.",
  "This study uses the Varshney 2011 connectome dataset of 279 neurons and 2287 synaptic connections and represents the network in binary graphs focusing on rich club topology rather than reporting synapse number based targets for specific neurons such as ASJ.",

  "Helicoidal Bouligand (circular Bragg) structures in scarab beetle cuticles produce near-circularly polarized reflections; Protaetia cuprea shows a double-resonance optical feature, and behavioral testing reported here indicates P. cuprea is not attracted to circularly polarized light during feeding or intraspecies communication.",
  "Linear polarization sensitivity is common among invertebrates, but circular polarization vision is uniquely documented in stomatopod crustaceans, indicating that most animals (including typical insect predators) are unlikely to perceive circularly polarized signals.",
  "Scarabaeidae (Lomaptera) beetle cuticles consist of birefringent chitin layers arranged in a helicoidal (cholesteric-like) Bouligand structure that selectively reflects circularly polarized light; the peak wavelength is set by the helical pitch (and average refractive index), while the reflected polarization state is determined by the helix handedness, and the biological advantages of this selective CP reflection remain unresolved.",
  "In scarab beetles, circularly polarized light reflection arises from helicoidal (Bouligand) structures in the exocuticle; these helicoids can be recognized in electron micrographs by their repeating lamellar ‘Bouligand curves.’.",
  "In Cetonia aurata, Potosia (Protaetia) cuprea, Anomala vitis, and Anomala dubia, a helicoidal exocuticle structure (optically analogous to cholesteric liquid crystals) produces left-circularly polarized reflections from the metallic cuticle, while surrounding host plant leaves are circularly unpolarized; across multiple choice experiments these species showed no attraction to circularly polarized stimuli in feeding or mate/conspecific-search contexts.",
  "In scarab beetles with metallic-shiny cuticles (Rutelidae, Cetoniidae), circular polarization of reflected light arises from a helical structure in the chitinous cuticle; while left-handed circular polarization from these regions has been documented, it remains unknown whether beetles can perceive circular polarization, as studied photoreceptors cannot distinguish left- from right-circularly polarized light.",
  "The paper explains that Ireland–Claisen rearrangements form C–C bonds from ester enolates or silyl ketene acetals via a chair-like [3,3]-sigmatropic transition state, with the typically more stable (E)-ketene acetal influencing the reaction’s diastereoselectivity.",

  "Jensen’s inequality establishes that for convex f, f of the weighted average is at most the weighted average of f, while for concave functions (e.g., ln, derived via convex −ln) the inequality reverses; the paper also provides quantitative converse bounds that upper-bound the gap between the average of f and f at the average in terms of variable and derivative ranges.",
  "Under a fixed-sum constraint, equal allocation x_i = (∑ x_j)/n is the least-dispersed point; because separable convex sums g(x)=∑ h(x_i) (with h convex) are Schur-convex, they increase with dispersion and thus take smaller values at equal allocations and larger values as variability among coordinates grows.",
  "For symmetric sums of the form Fn(x)=∑i f(xi), if f is concave then Fn is Schur-concave and is maximized by equalizing the variables (via F(x) ≤ F(mean,...,mean)), whereas for Schur-convex functions the equal allocation yields the minimum.",
  "The paper formalizes Jensen-type bounds for convex functions and states that these bounds reverse for concave functions, including extensions from two-point convex combinations to n-point settings and to more general affine combinations.",
  "The paper restates Jensen’s inequality: for strictly convex φ, E[φ(X)] − φ(E[X]) ≥ 0 with equality iff X is almost surely constant; for concave φ, applying the result to −φ yields reversed inequalities, providing bounds on φ(E[X]) − E[φ(X)].",
  "The paper formalizes majorization and Schur-convexity for two variables, shows that the equalized pair ((x1+x2)/2, (x1+x2)/2) is majorized by the original pair, and proves that the integral mean of a continuous function g is Schur-convex (Schur-concave) if and only if g is convex (concave), providing a basis for comparing symmetric outcomes under fixed-sum constraints.",

  "Karamata’s inequality states that for a convex function f, if a majorizes b then sum f(ai) ≥ sum f(bi); with nonnegative components summing to the same total, the extreme allocation (1,0,…,0) majorizes any other vector, which in turn majorizes the equal allocation (1/n,…,1/n), and for concave functions the inequality reverses.",
  "The number of 1H NMR signals corresponds to the number of chemically equivalent proton sets; molecular symmetry can reduce distinct sets, and stereochemistry matters: diastereotopic hydrogens are non-equivalent, while enantiotopic and homotopic hydrogens are equivalent (under typical achiral conditions), with counts referring to signals before coupling.",
  "In 1H NMR, the number of signals equals the number of electronically nonequivalent sets of hydrogens; homotopic and enantiotopic hydrogens are electronically equivalent and give the same signal, whereas diastereotopic hydrogens are electronically nonequivalent and generally give different signals.",
  "In a symmetric norbornane tribromide, symmetry markedly reduces the number of distinct NMR signals (e.g., only four lines in 13C NMR), and the 1H NMR matches this symmetry, with equivalences (such as two equivalent bridgehead protons) producing characteristic multiplets like a triplet for the bridge proton due to vicinal coupling to the equivalent neighbors.",
  "Diastereotopic atoms or groups are constitutionally equivalent yet not symmetry-related; replacing one of a diastereotopic pair generates one of two diastereoisomers, and hydrogens on a methylene group can serve as a specific example of such diastereotopic pairs.",

  "The study defines a lattice-gas Hamiltonian with site energies and both same-species nearest-neighbor and inter-species interactions, analyzes adsorption in the grand canonical ensemble as N(µ), and shows that in mean-field theory an effective coordination number z sets critical behavior, while exact 1D calculations yield quasitransitions rather than true thermodynamic transitions.",
  "The study models adsorption on a two-dimensional square lattice in the grand canonical ensemble using a lattice-gas Hamiltonian with site energy (ε0), nearest-neighbor interactions (wAA, wBB, wAB), and species chemical potentials (µA, µB); the square lattice has four nearest neighbors (coordination/connectivity c = 4) under periodic boundary conditions.",

  "The paper formulates adsorption on surfaces via a grand-canonical lattice-gas Hamiltonian with effective pair and multi-particle interactions and chemical potentials, defines coverage as the conjugate density to electrochemical potential, and demonstrates a mean-field multilayer treatment by relating second-layer coverage to first-layer variables through ΘS(2)=α ΘC (1/3−ΘS), establishing a framework directly applicable to multilayer adsorption modeling.",
  "An exact 1D lattice-gas adsorption model constructs grand partition functions via a transfer matrix (A with eigenvalues g1,g2, giving j0 = Tr A^M = g1^M + g2^M), defines adsorption (Gibbs surface excess) as N_ex = x ∂ ln[(j/j0)^{1/2}]/∂x at constant T, and in the strong-interaction limit yields the BET-type form N_ex ≈ zx/[(1−xy)(1−xy+zx)].",
  "In this lattice multilayer adsorption model, the grand partition function is Z = Tr exp(−βH), with H including nearest-neighbor interactions u(ki,kj,rij), a layer- and orientation-dependent surface potential V(l,k), and the chemical potential term; the energy of an n-layer film explicitly sums surface potential contributions, in-layer interaction energy, and interlayer interaction terms uinter between adjacent layers.",
  "In BALB/c (H-2d) mice, the influenza A nucleoprotein epitope NP147-155 has the sequence TYQRTRALV and is a class I CTL epitope routinely used to elicit and measure NP-specific CD8+ T cell responses.",
  "For the mouse H-2 Kd molecule, primary anchors are at peptide position 2 and the C-terminus; published motifs report Y/F at P2 and L/I/V/M at P9, while the combinatorial library identifies Y at P2 and I/L/V (with M tolerated) at P9, indicating strong preference for aromatic residues at P2 and hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus.",
  "This study identifies several verified H-2Kd-binding peptide sequences—including TYQRTRALV, IYATVAGSL, IYSTVASSL, SYIPSAEKI, and KYQAVTTTL—and shows that exogenous class I-binding peptides can access the ER of viable cells and bind newly synthesized class I molecules.",
  "NetMHCpan-4.1 predicts peptide–MHC class I binding and ligand likelihood across >11,000 alleles including mouse H-2, and classifies binders using %Rank thresholds (class I SB <0.5%, WB <2%), enabling standardized comparison and prioritization of candidate epitopes.",
  "The influenza A virus nucleoprotein peptide NP147–155 (sequence TYQRTRALV) is identified as an H-2Kd-restricted murine CD8 T cell epitope; vaccination with TYQRTRALV, especially when combined with adjuvants such as gp96 or CpG plus alum, elicits NP147–155-specific CD8 T cell responses and can confer measurable protection in mice.",
  "For H-2Kd, optimal binding is achieved by 9–10 mer peptides with Tyr at position 2 and a hydrophobic C-terminal residue (Leu, Ile, or Val); the influenza NP nonamer TYQRTRALV exemplifies this, and 9-mers with this motif bind/compete markedly better than longer counterparts (e.g., ~100-fold stronger in a photoaffinity assay).",
  "In an H-2Kb model system, higher-affinity peptide–MHC class I binding correlates with markedly more efficient antigen presentation and immunodominance; this affinity difference arises from faster association and slower dissociation kinetics and is strongly influenced by multiple non-anchor residues whose effects are context dependent and non-additive.",
  "Peptide addition to cell lysates stabilizes preexisting β2-microglobulin–associated, peptide-free MHC class I heavy chain complexes and increases the pool of assembled (W6/32-reactive) class I, whereas calnexin-bound β2m-free heavy chains are unaffected; in the proposed sequence, calnexin dissociates prior to peptide loading, after which peptide binding completes and stabilizes the complex.",
  "High-affinity class I MHC binding requires at least two anchor residues whose side chains fit optimally in their pockets; not all anchor combinations are compatible, and steric constraints (e.g., Tyr at P5 favoring small residues at P2) can determine whether presumed anchors actually yield strong binding.",
  "In peptide pulsing of cells, the number of peptide–MHC class I complexes formed on the surface depends on the peptide association rate (kon), dissociation rate (koff), the appearance rate of empty MHC (dM0/dt), and the denaturation rate of empty MHC (kden); different peptides exhibit distinct dissociation half-lives on the same MHC (e.g., OVA–Kb t1/2 ~14 h vs SIY–Kb ~5 h), which impacts surface complex accumulation at equal peptide concentrations.",
  "Peptide binding to MHC class I stabilizes heterodimer assembly and increases surface expression on RMA-S cells, and peptide-induced upregulation (e.g., Db with NP365–380) depends on exogenous β2-microglobulin from serum or purified sources, reflecting the instability of empty class I molecules at physiological temperature.",
  "MHC class I ligand identification benefits from recognizing that 9-mer peptides are generally preferred and from ranking candidates by percentile scores rather than fixed affinity thresholds, as percentile ranks provide more balanced identification across diverse MHC molecules due to differences in allele-specific affinity scales.",
  "H-2Kd binding of nonameric peptides is dominated by Tyr at P2 (B pocket), hydrophobic residues (Ile/Leu/Val) at P9 (F pocket), and size-limited residues at P5 (C pocket); substitutions of Tyr at P2 cause ~100-fold affinity loss for conservative changes and abolish binding for non-conservative ones, while large/charged residues at P5 reduce binding.",
  "Polymorphisms in the HLA-DR peptide-binding groove change which peptides are displayed; when these changes enhance presentation of disease-relevant self-antigens (e.g., citrullinated peptides via a positively charged P4 pocket), the associated allotypes show higher autoimmune disease risk, indicating that increased ability to present specific self-peptides is linked to increased disease susceptibility.",
  "Reduced thymic presentation of insulin (e.g., via lower expression linked to human INS VNTR alleles) undermines negative selection and predisposes to insulin-specific autoimmunity, whereas markedly increased antigen presentation efficiency (on the order of 100–1000-fold via targeted uptake) is associated with more effective presentation that supports the generation of a self-tolerant T cell repertoire.",
  "HLA class II polymorphisms (e.g., DQ2/DQ8 and their trans-heterodimers) determine peptide-binding preferences in the thymus, and preferential binding that fails to enforce central tolerance—particularly involving low-affinity peptide–HLA interactions—can facilitate the escape of autoreactive T cells and is linked to increased autoimmune risk.",
  "Strong TCR–self-pMHC interactions in the thymus generally induce negative selection to eliminate self-reactive clones, whereas weaker interactions support positive selection; AIRE-driven presentation of tissue-restricted antigens enhances deletion of high-affinity self-reactive T cells, and although stronger self-reactivity can increase the likelihood of regulatory T-cell differentiation, the most potent interactions still lead to clonal deletion.",
  "Structural features of HLA-DQ2, including positively charged residues at β70 and β71 (Arg-β70, Lys-β71), create a favorable environment for binding TG2-deamidated, proline-rich gluten epitopes, enabling their presentation to gluten-reactive T cells and explaining the strong HLA association observed in celiac disease.",
  "Under normal conditions, thymic negative selection deletes T cells with high affinity for self–peptide–MHC II; when this process is impaired (as in K14-Aβb mice), the repertoire becomes enriched for self–pMHC II–specific cells, exemplified by an at least 50-fold increase in IgM:I-Ab–specific CD4 single-positive thymocytes.",
  "In thymic development, presentation of self-antigens is required to induce negative selection (deletion) of strongly self-reactive thymocytes and prevent autoimmunity; strong TCR–self–peptide–MHC interactions drive negative selection, whereas weaker interactions drive positive selection, with a narrow affinity threshold separating the two outcomes.",
  "HLA class II polymorphisms concentrate in peptide-binding pockets and produce allele-specific peptide-binding preferences; certain alleles are linked to disease susceptibility (e.g., HLA-DQB1*0302), and class II pathways can present peptides derived from intracellular/self sources, providing a mechanistic basis for allele-dependent presentation of self antigens.",
  "Aire promotes central tolerance by inducing diverse tissue-specific antigen expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells, enabling deletion of autoreactive T cells and supporting regulatory T cell development; when Aire-driven antigen display is reduced, autoreactive T cells escape deletion and autoimmunity can result.",
  "Across multiple autoimmune diseases, HLA-DQ alleles that bind a larger fraction of disease-associated self-epitopes are associated with lower disease risk, indicating a protective role of DQ-mediated auto-epitope presentation in immune tolerance.",
  "Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) directly initiates somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination in germinal center B cells; sustained germinal center responses require CD40L-mediated T cell help; and TLR7/9 ligand recognition, particularly within B cells, enhances the quality of the germinal center response, including affinity maturation.",
  "In germinal centers, B cells rely on T cell–derived help (including CD40 costimulation) to proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation, and affinity maturation requires key mediators such as activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA).",
  "Continuous contact with MHC class II maintains naı̈ve CD4 T cell motility and their ability to interact with antigen-bearing dendritic cells; deprivation progressively reduces DC contact, CD69 induction, and proliferation to cognate antigen.",
  "AID is indispensable for antibody diversification via SHM and CSR; its N-terminal nuclear localization signal (residues 8–25) is essential for these functions, establishing that disruption within this region impairs AID-dependent processes.",
  "In vivo blockade of CD40L (gp39) with anti-gp39 profoundly suppresses both primary and secondary thymus-dependent antibody responses (including reductions across multiple isotypes such as IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgE), while leaving T-independent type II responses (e.g., TNP-Ficoll) unaltered, demonstrating the essential role of CD40–CD40L interactions in TD humoral immunity.",
  "- AID initiates SHM (which drives affinity maturation) and also CSR; in mice, reducing AID levels causes a quasi-proportional decrease in SHM and CSR, whereas increased AID expression elevates these processes, indicating that AID availability critically governs antibody diversification outcomes.",
  "In protein antigen immunization models where CpG (TLR9 ligand) is linked to antigen, TLR9/MyD88 signaling—especially within B cells—drives enhanced germinal center affinity maturation and high-affinity IgG production; conversely, B cell–specific MyD88 deficiency impairs affinity maturation and IgG2a class switching despite preserved plasma cell generation.",
  "In CD40-deficient mouse chimeras, T cell–dependent immunization (KLH) failed to elicit antigen-specific IgM or IgG and did not induce germinal centers, whereas responses to T cell–independent antigens (TNP-LPS, TNP-Ficoll) were normal, demonstrating the essential role of CD40-CD40L signaling in T cell–dependent antibody responses and isotype switching.",
  "CpG oligodeoxynucleotide responses signal via TLR9 through the MyD88-dependent Toll/IL-1R pathway; experimental blockade of MyD88 abrogates CpG-induced signaling, and MyD88-deficient mice exhibit a nonresponder phenotype to CpG-DNA.",
  "Mutating residues 137 and 142 in the β2 domain of MHC class II I-Ab disrupts CD4 binding in vivo, leading to significantly reduced development and peripheral frequencies of conventional CD4+ T helper cells and preventing positive selection of a CD4-dependent transgenic TCR, demonstrating that CD4–class II interactions are essential for building a complete helper T cell repertoire.",
  "In C57BL/6 mice immunized with Ad26-SIV Env, induction of antigen-specific serum antibodies required CD4+ T cell help via CD40 signaling: absence of CD40 or CD40L eliminated Env-specific antibodies at day 30, and MHC-II knockout mice (lacking CD4+ T cells) showed no Env-specific antibodies by day 60.",
  "In the canonical ensemble, state probabilities scale with the Boltzmann factor e^(−E/kT) and are normalized by the partition function Z; degeneracy is incorporated either by repeating degenerate energy levels in the discrete sum for Z or, in the continuous case, through a density of states D(E) in the integral form Z = ∫ D(E) e^(−E/kT) dE.",
  "For distinguishable particles, the canonical partition function requires a 1/N! factor, and in quantum systems the one-particle partition function is the sum over single-particle energy levels of e^(−β εℓ); together these yield ZN = (Z1)^N/N! and ensure ensemble equivalence.",
  "The paper defines the partition function as a sum over states weighted by degeneracies and Boltzmann factors (U = Σ g_n e^(−E_n/k_B T)), and the LTE population of each level follows the Boltzmann distribution (N_n/N = (g_n/U) e^(−E_n/k_B T)); the symbols U, Z, and Q are all used in the literature for the partition function.",
  "CODATA 2022 (published 2024) specifies exact SI values for key constants used in thermodynamic and statistical mechanics calculations: k = 1.380 649 × 10−23 J K−1, NA = 6.022 140 76 × 1023 mol−1, and the exact conversion 1 eV = 1.602 176 634 × 10−19 J; together with R = NA k (exact), these enable precise Boltzmann factor evaluations, eV↔J conversions, and mole-based population computations.",
  "The paper demonstrates that a subsystem weakly coupled to a large bath attains canonical behavior, with observables matching ⟨A⟩canβ = TrS[Ae−βHS]/TrS[e−βHS], thereby justifying use of the canonical partition function Z = TrS[e−βHS] and Boltzmann weights for level populations at inverse temperature β(E).",
  "The paper presents both the standard and axiomatic forms of the Boltzmann distribution, stating p_i = (1/Z) exp(−E_i/kT) with Z = Σ_j exp(−E_j/kT), and equivalently pS(si;B) = [1/Z(B,S)] exp(−E(si,S)/T(B)) with Z(B,S) = Σ_j exp(−E(sj,S)/T(B)), explicitly identifying Eq. (4) as the Boltzmann distribution.",
  "The paper constructs the canonical partition function by Laplace-transforming the density of states with respect to energy and shows that, under the model’s factorization, the many-particle partition function becomes a power of a suitably defined single-particle partition function, while emphasizing that microcanonical averages fix total energy and canonical averages fix β.",
  "The study models adsorption with a lattice gas having nearest-neighbor interactions of strength −ǫ (ǫ>0) and evaluates adsorption isotherms via mean-field theory using reduced variables T∗=kBT/ǫ and µ∗=µ/ǫ; within MFT, the critical temperature depends on an effective coordination number z and coupling (T∗=zJ/2), illustrating how coordination influences mean-field predictions of adsorption transitions.",
  "The paper provides core statistical-mechanical and thermodynamic foundations relevant to lattice-gas modeling: it restates the canonical partition function and free energy definitions, gives an operational chemical-potential balance condition under external potentials (µ(ρ1)+u1=µ(ρ2)+u2), and specifies a concrete lattice-gas Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor interactions, HΛ(η) = −J Σ⟨x,y⟩ ηxηy.",
  "The paper formulates renormalized Hamiltonians using lattice-gas variables ni = (1 − σi)/2 (values 0 or 1), expanding them as cluster sums over finite subsets with coefficients c(Y), and provides exact inversion relations to obtain spin-variable coefficients d(Y) from the lattice-gas coefficients, establishing a rigorous bridge between lattice-gas and spin representations.",
  "In a grand-canonical lattice-gas model of chemisorption with binary occupation variables, the system energy includes a chemical-potential term and pair interactions; the grand partition function is Z = Σ_c exp[−H(c)/(RT)], and the average coverage (occupancy per site) is obtained via Θ = (1/N) ∂ ln Z / ∂(μ̄/RT), directly linking occupancy to the chemical potential and interaction parameters.",
  "In the Bragg–Williams mean-field treatment of order–disorder with nearest-neighbour interactions (coordination Z), the effective interaction is often taken linear in order (V = V0 S), and the ordering energy scales as Es − E0 = −(1/2) N Z VB S^2 with V0 = 2 Z VB, while equilibrium follows from minimizing F = u − Tφ (i.e., ∂F/∂S = 0).",
  "The paper formulates a lattice-gas model for adsorption in the grand canonical ensemble in which each lattice site can be occupied by at most one molecule (ni ∈ {0,1}); the Hamiltonian sums site-specific adsorption Gibbs free energies and explicit pairwise lateral interaction energies over all sites and components, providing a GCMC-ready description for mixtures on a lattice of adsorption sites.",
  "The paper formulates a grand canonical lattice gas model where each site has a site-specific adsorption Gibbs free energy ΔGi and pairwise lateral interaction energies Eij; occupancy variables ni(c) ∈ {0,1} enforce single occupancy per site with Σc ni(c) = ni ∈ {0,1}, providing the Hamiltonian basis for GCMC simulations on a lattice of adsorption sites.",
  "The paper defines the grand-canonical partition function for an adsorption model with dynamic ligands and, via a mean-field grand potential formulation, derives a Langmuir-like self-consistency equation for average occupancy where the effective Langmuir parameter depends on the fraction of ligands in the rotated state.",
  "The paper formulates a mean-field (Bragg–Williams) description where the ordering energy depends uniquely on a global order parameter S; when interactions are restricted to nearest neighbours each site has Z neighbours, and the approach becomes exact in the large-Z limit, with the nearest-neighbour interaction scheme providing a bridge to Bethe’s treatment and an explicit relation between interaction parameters and effective ordering energy.",
  "The paper identifies common real-world corruptions—including low-light Gaussian noise and motion blur—and demonstrates that preprocessing with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) can improve robustness across many corruptions (e.g., reducing a ResNet-50 model’s mCE from 76.7% to 74.5%).",
  "The paper identifies illumination variation (including night-time conditions) and motion blur as common challenges in camera trap images and reports using random cropping, horizontal flipping, and color distortion as data augmentation in classification experiments, indicating the relevance of augmentations that address lighting and motion-related variability.",
  "When training deep models that exploit defocus blur as a cue, the authors avoid augmentations that alter out-of-focus characteristics and restrict augmentations to random crops and horizontal flips, with experiments demonstrating that preserving defocus information yields substantial performance gains (including 10–20 percentage point accuracy improvements on a real DSLR dataset).",
  "The benchmarks catalog common corruptions (e.g., Gaussian/shot/impulse noise, defocus/motion/zoom blur, brightness/contrast changes, pixelation, JPEG artifacts) and common perturbations (e.g., motion/zoom blur, brightness, translate/rotate/tilt, scale), and report that modern classifiers can be unexpectedly unstable under such perturbations.",
  "The paper highlights that camera trap images frequently suffer from illumination issues and motion blur at night, variable ROI size, occlusion, camouflage, and perspective changes, and notes that a baseline model used random cropping, horizontal flipping, and random color distortion as data augmentation.",
  "Defocus blur is a pervasive property of natural images and systematically reduces high-frequency content, with the magnitude of blur governed by optical factors (e.g., pupil diameter and lens properties); this establishes predictable frequency-domain signatures of defocus that can be exploited or modeled in image-based systems.",
  "Digital imaging sensor raw-data noise is best modeled as a signal-dependent Poissonian-Gaussian process; over/under-exposure introduces clipping that causes a nonlinear sensor response, and higher ISO (analog gain) increases noise and worsens SNR—factors that should be reflected when simulating deployment-like image conditions.",
  "The paper models raw pixels as approximately linear in collected radiant energy and explains that noise variance arises from photon noise plus additive readout and ADC components whose effects depend on ISO; under fixed exposure time, increasing ISO can raise SNR in darker regions until saturation, illustrating a ‘high ISO advantage.’.",
  "This study measured near-infrared illumination outputs for seven camera trap models and found model-specific, stable wavelengths with minimal within-model variability (e.g., Reconyx HC600 ~940.5 nm; Scoutguard 550 ~828.3 nm; Scoutguard 680 V ~844.1 nm), indicating deployed camera-trap imagery is captured under near-IR lighting conditions that differ by device.",
  "Snapshot Serengeti camera traps operated day and night using infrared or incandescent flash, with infrared producing poorer night-image quality that led to a switch to incandescent; cameras were triggered by heat and motion and captured bursts of 1–3 images per event.",
  "Defocus blur in images is effectively modeled as a spatially varying Gaussian low-pass filtering process, where the degree of blur increases with distance from the focal plane and can be parameterized by the Gaussian kernel’s σ.",
  "Deer can perceive standard IR (≈850 nm) and show stronger behavioral reactions to it than to black flash (≈940 nm), which behaves similarly to no flash in daylight, indicating black flash is likely not visible to deer.",
  "The paper examines a novel tetracyclic (CH)10 system and identifies two key thermal processes—central sigma-bond cleavage and cyclobutene ring opening—with particular emphasis on the behavior of a highly strained 3,2,2-propellane derivative.",
  "The paper introduces Pterodactyladiene (the parent (CH)10 tetracyclic hydrocarbon) as a highly strained member of the (CH)10 family and describes a new synthetic route enabling preparation of the unsubstituted parent compound (la).",
  "The paper highlights use of named polycyclic hydrocarbons—Dewar benzene as a precursor in thermolysis studies and cis,cis-bishomobenzene’s thermal instability in organometallic cycloaddition contexts—illustrating naming conventions and stability considerations for these systems.",
  "The supporting information centers on a mechanophore named pterodactylane, referring to a pterodactylane repeat unit that converts to a diene under thermal/mechanical conditions and listing an SMFS threshold force of 709 pN for pterodactylane.",
  "Pterosaurs are documented to have vanished at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary (~66 million years ago), with multiple statements indicating their disappearance at the end of the Cretaceous and framing their loss as an abrupt, boundary-associated extinction.",
  "The study assesses cranial kinesis across pterosaurs, concluding that despite synovial-like joints in some taxa, the absence of permissive kinematic linkages indicates pterosaur skulls were akinetic, with such features likely reflecting ontogenetic/mechanical roles or ancestral remnants rather than true intracranial mobility.",
  "The study categorized bumble bee mimicry rings using human perception, instructing untrained students to group species by visual similarity as if they were predators, justified by evidence that predator and human generalization of aposematic patterns align; it further emphasizes using field images alongside templates to better represent ecological appearance and assesses geographic concordance across ecoregions.",
  "In hoverflies, perceived mimetic accuracy is influenced by viewing angle and varies by species; while human judgments can correlate with avian predator responses, the paper emphasizes that differences in predators’ sensory and cognitive systems—and reliance on standard top-down imagery—can limit the ecological validity of human-based assessments.",
  "In hover flies, human ratings of mimetic fidelity significantly tracked an objective multivariate similarity metric and aligned with mimicry-related behaviors, indicating that human-based assessments capture biologically meaningful mimicry relevant to predator-driven selection.",
  "The paper emphasizes that evaluating bumble bee mimicry should be based on objective, detailed color-pattern metrics aligned with predator-driven selection pressures (heightened under Batesian load), operationalized by computing similarity coefficients from standardized 32-region body coding and clustering species based on those quantitative resemblance measures.",
  "Predator-focused experiments show that birds can evaluate mimetic similarity differently from humans, with pigeons sometimes judging species that look like poor mimics to humans as good mimics, indicating that human visual similarity rankings may not capture the ecologically relevant features used by predators.",
  "The paper emphasizes that assessments of mimetic similarity should be grounded in the intended predator’s sensory ecology and real encounter context; humans can perceive patterns differently from predators, and predators often apply simple, salient traits (e.g., stripe color) rather than holistic or multi-trait similarity when discriminating prey.",
  "In the DM300-328 DM1 mouse model, MSH2 is required for CTG repeat expansions: loss of MSH2 shifts instability from expansions to contractions (observed in somatic tissues and across generations), while germinal expansions arise premeiotically in spermatogonia via an MSH2-dependent, meiosis-independent mechanism.",
  "In a DM1 knock-in mouse, somatic CTG•CAG repeat expansion is strongly enriched in polyploid (≥4n) hepatocytes and 4n pancreatic acinar cells, whereas diploid (2n) cells largely retain progenitor-length repeats; expansion severity increases with age.",
  "In DM1, MSH3 exon 1 repeat variation modifies CTG somatic instability: the 3a allele shows a significant meta-analytic association with reduced somatic expansion across HD and DM1, and within DM1, seven-repeat alleles are associated with reduced expansion rate.",
  "In DM1 transgenic mice carrying the 46BR LigI mutation (heterozygous or homozygous), somatic CTG repeat instability patterns across multiple tissues remained unchanged compared to LigI wild-type mice, as shown by both standard PCR and small-pool PCR analyses.",
  "In DM1, CTG repeats show progressive, tissue-specific somatic expansion during life, and DNA repair pathways—especially mismatch repair (e.g., MSH3)—modulate this instability, indicating repair-dependent mechanisms are key drivers of repeat dynamics in affected tissues.",
  "This paper does not evaluate LIG1 or ligase-related knockouts; instead, it reports that somatic CTG repeat expansions occur in DM1, are lower in blood than in muscle/heart, can confound genotype–phenotype correlations, and may be influenced by replication patterns associated with adjacent methylation.",
  "In primate cell extract assays, reducing LIG1 ligation activity did not alter CTG/CAG repeat instability, whereas either overexpressing LIG1 or expressing a PCNA-binding–deficient LIG1 increased both expansions and contractions during replication; in yeast, disruption of the LIG1 homolog (cdc9) further increased contraction-biased instability.",
  "The paper derives a biologically plausible single-layer network where feedforward synapses use local Hebbian updates and lateral synapses use local anti-Hebbian updates; at stationarity the learned filters are orthonormal and span the principal subspace, with stability only when they align with the top-m covariance eigenvectors, and synchronous activity updates converge only if the lateral weight matrix has spectral radius less than one.",
  "Wilson and Cowan introduce a correlation term between excitation and sensitivity but assume it to be negligible (set to zero) for richly interconnected populations; they also interpret certain parameter inequalities as requiring a relatively strong excitatory–inhibitory negative feedback loop, shaping the system’s stability and hysteresis behavior.",
  "Homeostatic synaptic plasticity implements opposing (push–pull) pathways for scaling up and down such that, at a particular level of somatic calcium influx, these processes balance to define a firing-rate set point; synaptic scaling restores baseline activity while preserving the relative differences in synaptic strengths established by Hebbian mechanisms.",
  "Model examples in this paper used mildly correlated inputs (~0.35 cross-correlation) and strongly correlated inputs (~0.61); with STDP-only, even mild correlation produced runaway potentiation, whereas adding heterosynaptic plasticity stabilized weights and maintained homeostasis across a wide range of presynaptic correlations.",
  "The paper demonstrates that sampling Fano factor values depend on firing intensity and recommends comparing variability in operational time (wo = wλ), defining Fo(wo) = F(wo/λ), which yields an intensity-independent measure (for equilibrium renewal processes) suitable for cross-condition comparisons.",
  "Hopfield (1984) formalizes a graded-response neural network in which each neuron's output can be interpreted as the short-term average firing rate, the subthreshold dynamics follow RC leaky integration, and in a suitable limit the stochastic action-potential description converges to the same continuous rate-based dynamics—providing theoretical grounding for rate-model analyses of network behavior and plasticity.",
  "The paper concludes that independent Poisson synaptic inputs are insufficient to reproduce the high firing variability of cortical neurons; instead, achieving such variability requires either fast, strong dendritic nonlinearities or strong temporal synchronization of inputs such that a majority of EPSPs are coincident on millisecond timescales (effectively reducing the number of inputs needed to trigger spikes to near 1–2).",
  "In the BCM framework, synaptic change is positive when postsynaptic activity exceeds a modification threshold and negative when it is below; this threshold is a sliding function of the neuron’s average postsynaptic activity, thereby defining a critical activity level at which potentiation and depression balance.",
  "The paper quantifies weak pairwise correlations among cortical neurons (typically ~0.1–0.2) and shows that such correlations set a non-negligible limit on averaging: pooled uncertainty approaches √r#, so with r# = 0.2, 100 neurons provide about the same uncertainty as five independent neurons; it also demonstrates that the stable variance-to-mean ratio scales with both CVISI and r# (e.g., CVISI = 0.8 and r# = 0.2 yield a ratio of 1.6 for a simple three-term calculation).",
  "The paper shows that cortical pair correlations decay slowly with distance in resting states but rapidly under stimulation, and that a balanced excitation–inhibition regime within Wilson–Cowan dynamics reproduces these correlation patterns in simulations.",
  "Across input spike-train correlations characterized by average cross-correlations from 0.336 to 0.605, heterosynaptic plasticity (driven by postsynaptic calcium rises) prevented runaway potentiation/depression under STDP and maintained synaptic weights within a normal, unsaturated operating range.",
  "Under Poisson spiking, the triplet STDP model yields an analytically computable expected weight change that can be written in BCM form with a sliding threshold proportional to the expected p-th power of postsynaptic firing; specifically, setting A2 terms to scale with ⟨νy^p⟩/ν0^p leads to a threshold θ = ⟨νy^p⟩(A2−τ− + A2+τ+)/(ν0^p A3+τ+τy), separating depression from potentiation.",
  "MMP9 cleaves proBDNF to mature BDNF and is required for the consolidation phase of LTP; MMP9-driven potentiation of excitatory synapses depends on integrin signaling (notably β1), establishing a mechanistic link between MMP9 activity, BDNF/TrkB signaling, and changes in synaptic efficacy.",
  "The paper prescribes a systematic multiscale reduction workflow: identify fast (slaved) versus slow species, enforce QSS or QE algebraic constraints to eliminate fast components, pool reactions or species accordingly, and then compute effective kinetic laws so the reduced model evolves only in the slow variables whose number equals the count of non-slaved species.",
  "The review formalizes synaptic weight dynamics as a three-factor rule in which the weight change equals a neuromodulatory factor multiplied by a Hebbian coincidence term; the Hebbian term can be implemented via an eligibility trace that low-pass filters pre/post spike-timing coincidences, and setting the modulator to a constant recovers the non-modulated STDP case.",
  "The review formalizes a compact synaptic learning framework with two explicit synaptic variables—weight (wij) and an internal eligibility trace (eij)—where eij integrates presynaptic (xj) and postsynaptic (yi) factors via deij/dt = η fj(xj) gi(yi) − eij/τe, and updates to wij occur only when a modulatory third factor M3rd(t) is present, according to dwij/dt = eij M3rd(t).",
  "Neuromodulators often act as a required third factor that gates STDP, with postsynaptic calcium transients encoding pre–post coincidence and time-decaying eligibility traces allowing later neuromodulator receptor activation to convert prior spike-pairing into lasting synaptic change.",
  "The paper models synaptic plasticity with a synaptic efficacy variable ρ(t) evolving with time constant τ and driven by postsynaptic calcium c(t), where c(t) is the linear sum of pre- and postsynaptic calcium transients, and synaptic strength w is taken as a linear function of ρ.",
  "High-frequency stimulation promotes extracellular conversion of secreted proBDNF to mBDNF via tPA/plasmin, shifting the extracellular proBDNF/mBDNF ratio toward mBDNF (supporting LTP), whereas low-frequency stimulation elevates extracellular proBDNF (supporting LTD) without inducing tPA secretion.",
  "The paper describes QSSA as a reduction technique that sets the time derivative of fast intermediates to zero to obtain algebraic relations, which are then substituted back to lower the system’s dimensionality (e.g., reducing a three-species system to two), while cautioning that such reductions can alter qualitative dynamics compared to the full model.",
  "BDNF acting via TrkB elevates postsynaptic Ca2+ (through PLCγ and TRPC channels) and enhances presynaptic glutamate release, supporting LTP-related mechanisms, while proBDNF signaling via p75NTR is required for NMDAR-dependent LTD, indicating opposing pre- and postsynaptic influences on synaptic efficacy.",
  "Experiments show that MMP-9 is released within seconds from stimulated dendritic spines, is necessary for transient and sustained TrkB activation during sLTP, and directly cleaves proBDNF into mature BDNF in a cell-free assay.",
  "Under the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA), each species is represented by a ‘hat’ (total) variable that sums its free form and all enzyme–substrate complexes containing it; fast complex dynamics are eliminated via algebraic constraints, yielding a reduced differential–algebraic system in a standard form that captures the slow dynamics of coupled enzymatic reaction networks.",
  "The model formalizes synaptic weight dynamics as a calcium-driven process with bidirectional modification: below a lower calcium threshold no change occurs, intermediate calcium induces LTD, and high calcium induces LTP, stabilized by a decay term and with a learning rate that increases monotonically with calcium.",
  "In hippocampal slices, deletion of p75NTR selectively impairs the maintenance (but not induction) of LTD without affecting LTP; BDNF–TrkB signaling is required for LTP, while precursor neurotrophins such as proBDNF preferentially bind p75NTR and, when not proteolytically cleaved to mature BDNF (a process essential for late-phase LTP), facilitate LTD.",
  "In mouse lateral amygdala slices, LTP at thalamo-amygdala synapses depends on acute postsynaptic TrkB signaling: BDNF scavenging (TrkB-IgG) or postsynaptic TrkB kinase inhibition (intracellular K252a) abolishes LTP, whereas baseline synaptic measures remain unchanged.",
  "In a PTZ-induced mouse kindling model, hippocampal MMP-9 promotes seizure progression by converting pro-BDNF to mature BDNF; this is supported by delayed kindling in MMP-9(\u0001/\u0001) mice, suppression of kindling by the BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc in wild-type but not MMP-9(\u0001/\u0001) mice, and enhancement of kindling by hippocampal pro-BDNF in wild-type but not MMP-9(\u0001/\u0001) mice.",
  "In hippocampal area CA1, MMP-9 is rapidly and transiently upregulated and required for induction of L-LTP in an NMDA receptor- and protein synthesis-dependent manner, and exogenous active MMP-9 induces a slow potentiation that is prevented by integrin-blocking reagents, whereas MMP-9 is not required for E-LTP or LTD.",
  "The triplet STDP model uses pre- (r1, r2) and postsynaptic (o1, o2) accumulators that are incremented at spike times and decay with distinct time constants; synaptic weight updates at pre- or postsynaptic spikes depend on products of these accumulators (pair and triplet terms), and under Poisson spiking the expected weight change is a sum of terms proportional to products of presynaptic and postsynaptic firing rates, enabling a mapping to BCM-like dynamics.",
  "Endogenous MMP-9 activity is required for stable LTP and spine enlargement, exogenous MMP-9 application is sufficient to produce persistent structural and functional potentiation at naive hippocampal spines, and these MMP-9-induced effects are abolished by blocking β1-containing integrin receptors.",
  "Combining the efflux pump inhibitor PA\u0001N with iron chelators (2,2\u0002-dipyridyl, acetohydroxamic acid, or EDTA) produced synergistic inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth and reduced biofilm formation, with PA\u0001N-EDTA being particularly effective even at low EDTA concentrations.",
  "In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, swarming on semisolid surfaces requires functional flagella and biosurfactant production; exogenous rhamnolipids (or rhamnolipid-containing supernatants) inhibit swarming, and while an rhlA mutant is nonswarming, rhlB and rhlC mutants can swarm (with altered patterns), indicating distinct roles of rhamnolipid pathway components in swarming motility.",
  "In this study, twitching motility was measured using a subsurface agar assay initiated by stab inoculation through 1% agar, with overnight growth at 37°C and visualization of the interfacial motility zone between agar and the petri dish via Coomassie blue staining.",
  "In this study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility was assayed by sub-agar stab inoculation, and iron chelation was noted to stimulate twitching motility and alter biofilm architecture, with twitching being a type IV pili–mediated surface motility.",
  "Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces pyoverdin, a yellowish-green fluorescent siderophore that can impart a dramatic green color to culture media and wounds; however, not all clinical isolates produce pyoverdin (2 of 40 strains tested were negative).",
  "In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the siderophore pyoverdine is UV-fluorescent due to its quinolinic chromophore, binds a wide range of metal ions beyond iron (including Ag+, Al3+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Ga3+, Hg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Zn2+), and is exported—along with non-iron pyoverdine–metal complexes—via the PvdRT-OpmQ efflux system, reflecting a role in metal homeostasis.",
  "In Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, EDTA—identified by the authors as a metal chelator—significantly decreased swarming motility at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations, indicating that metal chelation can inhibit swarming under the tested conditions.",
  "Iron chelators (2,2’-bipyridyl, lipoic acid, kojic acid, picolinic acid) significantly inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa swarming motility at 100 µM, with inhibition ranging from 20% to 84% depending on the chelator and strain, and lipoic acid showing the strongest effect.",
  "Pseudomonas aeruginosa swarming on semisolid agar is modulated by nutrients and cellular structures: glycerol can serve as a carbon source for swarming but less effectively than glucose; rhl quorum-sensing mutants (rhlI/rhlR) do not swarm; and type IV pili are essential, as pilA and pilR mutants fail to swarm.",
  "In this study, twitching motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assayed by stab inoculating cultures to the bottom of LB 1% agar plates and incubating them inverted at 37°C for 16–24 hours.",
  "In standard Pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching assays, interstitial colony expansion is initiated by stab inoculation; for 100 mm × 15 mm petri dishes, plates are prepared with approximately 25 mL of 1.2% agar medium prior to inoculation.",
  "A standardized Pseudomonas aeruginosa swarming assay uses 100 mm (10-cm) petri plates poured as thick plates at approximately 25 mL per plate, with green pigments becoming more apparent after a brief room-temperature period following incubation.",
  "The study specifies that Pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility is measured using a subsurface agar method initiated by stab inoculation through 1% agar; motility develops at the agar–petri dish interface and is visualized by Coomassie staining.",
  "Pyocyanin is a blue-green phenazine pigment produced by most Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates; during culture it appears as a blue-green pigment, and it can be distinguished from the also-green pyoverdine because pyocyanin is chloroform-soluble whereas pyoverdine is not.",
  "Oophaga pumilio shows extensive color variation: the widespread mainland phenotype is red dorsally and ventrally with dark blue limbs, whereas island populations in Bocas del Toro include derived orange, green, and blue morphs, with Isla Bastimentos notably polymorphic (orange and green most common, but red and yellowish also present).",
  "In this study, the Isla Colón population is described as green frogs with a dark-spotted dorsal pattern on a green (or yellow) background and bright yellow ventral regions.",
  "In the Bocas del Toro region, Oophaga pumilio exhibits distinct plain-colored morphs with blue, red, and green dorsal skin, exemplified by sampled populations at Tierra Oscura (blue), Isla Popa (green), and Almirante (red), while the species’ ancestral phenotype is bright red.",
  "The study identifies the Oophaga pumilio population from Isla Bocas—explicitly noted as also being ‘Isla Colon’—with the primary coloration described as green with spots.",
  "On Isla Colón (Bocas Island), Oophaga (Dendrobates) pumilio exhibits a forest-green dorsum covered with large black spots on the back and limbs, contrasted by a bright yellow venter.",
  "For resistant hypertension, guideline-directed pharmacotherapy is: (1) maximize a long-acting CCB + ACE inhibitor/ARB + diuretic regimen—prefer a thiazide-like agent (chlorthalidone) over hydrochlorothiazide due to greater SBP reduction; (2) if BP remains above goal, add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (e.g., spironolactone) as the preferred fourth-line agent.",
  "In angina or hypertension, once-daily sustained-release diltiazem at 200–300 mg reduces heart rate in a regulating manner (greater reduction at higher baseline HR, without excessive bradycardia), and when a calcium antagonist is indicated, HR-lowering agents like diltiazem are recommended over dihydropyridines.",
  "Guidelines and evidence in this review support CCBs as acceptable first-line or add-on agents, emphasize multi-drug regimens (including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β blockers, or CCBs) for stage 2 hypertension, and note that African American patients often experience better BP lowering with CCB or diuretic monotherapy compared with ACEi/ARB/β blocker monotherapy, although this difference narrows when ACEi/ARB/β blocker therapy is combined with a diuretic.",
  "A 2017 meta-analysis found that thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone, indapamide) reduced blood pressure more than hydrochlorothiazide without increasing risks of hypokalemia, hyponatremia, glucose, or total cholesterol changes; chlorthalidone has a longer half-life (~42 hours) and generally requires 50–75% of the equivalent hydrochlorothiazide dose, and large trials have shown outcome benefits such as reduced stroke rates with chlorthalidone.",
  "ACC/AHA guidance identifies chlorthalidone as the preferred diuretic and advises substituting HCTZ with indapamide or chlorthalidone in resistant hypertension; for Black patients, guidelines recommend a thiazide-like diuretic or a CCB as first-line therapy, and ACC/AHA also advises adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for resistant hypertension.",
  "In resistant hypertension persisting on standard triple therapy (A + C + D), spironolactone 25–50 mg/day was the most effective fourth-line add-on, lowering home systolic blood pressure more than doxazosin or bisoprolol and achieving control (<135 mm Hg) in about 60% of patients; doxazosin or bisoprolol are less effective alternatives when spironolactone is not tolerated.",
  "In high-risk hypertensive patients, benazepril plus amlodipine reduced major cardiovascular events versus benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide with nearly identical achieved blood pressures; the authors conclude ACE inhibitor–calcium channel blocker combinations are a reasonable, possibly preferable, first-choice when multiple agents are needed, and major guidelines deem thiazides, beta-blockers, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs all suitable for initiation and maintenance of therapy.",
  "In ALLHAT, initial therapy with chlorthalidone or amlodipine prevented more in-trial strokes than lisinopril, with the disadvantage of lisinopril concentrated among Black participants and women; over 10-year follow-up including post-trial surveillance, overall stroke rates converged across treatments.",
  "In Black patients with hypertension, the paper emphasizes combination therapy, noting that ARBs may be preferred over ACEIs due to higher ACEI-related angioedema/cough in Blacks, CCB-containing combinations may be favored when diabetes risk is present because diuretics can worsen glycemic control, and an ACEI/ARB is considered an essential component of most combination regimens.",
  "For stage 2 hypertension the guideline recommends initiating two first-line agents (ACE inhibitor/ARB, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide diuretic); in Black adults initial therapy should include a thiazide-type diuretic or a calcium channel blocker, and for resistant hypertension the most strongly supported add-on is spironolactone, shown superior to alpha- or beta-blockers in PATHWAY-2.",
  "Heating crotyl vinyl ethers under reflux in xylene induces a Claisen rearrangement that furnishes 4-pentenals in good yields (typically 83–89%), with representative reaction times of 5–7 hours.",
  "Chalcogenoxide eliminations proceed via an intramolecular Ei pathway in which the X=O oxygen abstracts a β-proton with concerted C–X bond cleavage to generate a C=C bond; the analogous transformation occurs for sulfoxides but generally requires higher temperatures than selenoxides.",
  "In the Claisen rearrangement of allyl vinyl ether, allyl acetaldehyde is formed via a pathway where C4–O bond breaking and C1–C6 bond formation occur to yield a product confirmed by vibrational bands at 1030, 1150, and 1750 cm−1, and the detailed transition state structure is influenced by substitution and solvent.",
  "Sulfenic acids can be generated in situ from sulfoxides by a syn, concerted elimination through a five-membered transition state; the ease and conditions of thermolysis are strongly influenced by substituents (electron-withdrawing β-groups and sterically demanding α-groups) and by reaction variables such as solvent and temperature.",
  "Transient sulfenic acids can be generated from sulfoxide precursors by thermolysis or β-elimination, and these sulfenic acids undergo cyclic, concerted, Markovnikov addition to alkenes to form sulfoxides—the microscopic reverse of sulfenic acid elimination from sulfoxides.",
  "The paper emphasizes that nanoscale systems exhibit thermodynamic behaviors distinct from bulk materials due to surface-to-volume ratio, topology, and finite-size effects, leading to thermodynamic signatures (such as heat capacity jumps) that depend on size and geometry rather than solely on sample mass.",
  "Ordered and densely packed ligand monolayers on nanoparticle facets generate cohesive, attractive interactions between opposing surfaces—with strengths on the order of ~2 kT per nm2—showing that ligand shells can form energetically significant, tightly packed structures whose interactions depend on coverage, facet dimensions, and temperature.",
  "Dissolution calorimetry of oleate-capped InP quantum dots in hydrochloric acid shows a linear increase of dissolution enthalpy with molar surface area (smaller size), yielding a positive slope that corresponds to a negative surface energy; the analysis corrects for oleate protonation and attributes the negative surface energy to strong ligand–surface bonding that stabilizes surface atoms relative to the interior.",
  "Powder X-ray diffraction shows that aliphatic ligand shells on InP quantum dots are ordered and exhibit interligand van der Waals interactions whose strength and structural ordering depend on ligand length and temperature; the relative ligand signal decreases with increasing quantum dot size, indicating a larger proportion of organic material on smaller quantum dots.",
  "InP quantum dots synthesized here are capped with oleic acid or oleylamine; XPS survey and core-level analyses show a high carbon signal and an oxygen peak attributable to ligand carboxylates, evidencing substantial organic ligand coverage on the QD surface.",
  "Dissolution calorimetry of oleate-capped InP quantum dots in HCl, with enthalpies corrected for Teflon and oleate protonation, shows a positive slope of enthalpy versus molar surface area that indicates a negative surface energy; the authors attribute this to strong ligand binding that stabilizes surface atoms more than interior bonds.",
  "In water, hydrophobic association of small nonpolar alkyl chains is entropically favorable but enthalpically unfavorable (positive enthalpy), and increasing alkyl chain length strengthens hydrophobic interactions and modestly increases ordering in carboxylic acid dimers, reflecting the interplay of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effects, and entropy.",
  "The study highlights that InP QDs possess rich surface properties and are commonly modified via ligand exchange (e.g., S2− capping); XPS evidence shows interfacial interactions (and possible In–N/O bond formation) when combined with CQDs, underscoring that surface ligands and interfacial chemistry significantly affect QD behavior.",
  "DFT and experimental evidence indicate that InP(001) surfaces have a strong thermodynamic drive to oxidize, forming mainly In−O−P bonds (with In−O−In less favored), and that oxidation increases surface stability while being kinetically hindered; In-rich InP surfaces rapidly form oxides even at low oxygen exposures at room temperature, and substitutional oxidation disrupts surface order.",
  "GWAS-based polygenic scores can reflect both direct genetic effects (δ) and indirect parental ‘genetic nurture’ effects (η), such that variance explained by transmitted alleles scales with (δ + η)² (and with (δ + η)² + η² when including non-transmitted alleles), whereas heritability is defined as variance due to direct effects alone, and GWAS signals can be amplified by genetic nurture and assortative mating.",
  "Across multilocus models under Hardy–Weinberg and linkage equilibrium, epistatic interactions largely contribute to additive genetic variance via average effects; in outbred populations with many loci, epistatic variance is expected to be small and is unlikely to account for missing heritability.",
  "SNP-based heritability estimates from methods applied to unrelated individuals (e.g., GREML, LDSR) quantify narrow-sense heritability by capturing direct, additive effects of common variants and typically provide a lower bound relative to total (broad-sense) heritability, which also includes dominance and epistatic components.",
  "The study shows that typical GWAS-based polygenic scores—particularly those leveraging sub-significant SNPs or meta-analyses of heterogeneous cohorts—are vulnerable to subtle population stratification, which can generate spurious signals of polygenic adaptation and limit the reliability and portability of polygenic score comparisons across and even within populations.",
  "Epigenetic modifications can elevate average disease risk, but unless they persist for many generations they contribute little to recurrence risk and heritability; if they do persist long-term, they behave like mutations and are likely captured by GWAS via linkage disequilibrium with SNPs, making epigenetics an unlikely explanation for missing heritability despite potentially explaining missing causality.",
  "Polygenic score predictions in unrelated individuals can incorporate confounding from population stratification, assortative mating, and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects; within-family designs remove these biases and show that GPS prediction for cognitive traits (e.g., IQ and educational achievement) is substantially attenuated (about 50–60%) compared with between-family estimates, indicating that GPS prediction can reflect indirect environmental pathways in addition to direct genetic effects.",
  "PGS-based predictions for educational outcomes currently under-capture heritability and can be upwardly biased if genetic nurture is not accounted for; in this meta-analysis, PGS explained ~2.89% (direct) and ~1.28% (nurture) of variance versus higher family-based RDR benchmarks (17% and 6.6%), indicating both limitations and an empirical ceiling for potential PGS improvements.",
  "The paper shows that while PRS accuracy improves with larger GWAS, standard pruning+thresholding methods underperform relative to SNP heritability in LD settings, whereas LDpred’s modeling of LD allows its prediction accuracy to converge to the SNP heritability as sample size increases.",
  "- Using genome-wide SNP data across 79 human quantitative traits, the study estimated mean additive SNP heritability (h2_SNP) of ~0.15 and mean dominance SNP variance (d2_SNP) of ~0.03, concluding that dominance at common SNPs explains only a small fraction of phenotypic variance and contributes little to missing narrow-sense heritability; moreover, GWAS typically fit additive models, so the variance they explain is, by definition, additive.",
  "Using genome-wide SNP data in unrelated individuals estimates only the additive heritability tagged by genotyped SNPs (“chip heritability”); untagged genetic variation is not captured, and uneven LD can bias estimates by overestimating contributions from well-tagged regions and underestimating those from poorly tagged regions.",
  "Typical GWAS-based polygenic scores aggregate combined direct and indirect genetic effects; because the traditional heritability refers to direct genetic effects only, the theoretical upper limit of genetic prediction from probands’ alleles can exceed the heritability.",
  "For complex traits, SNP-based estimates from common variants typically explain about one-third to two-thirds of total heritability; gaps relative to pedigree heritability can reflect insufficient tagging of rare variants and possible non-additive effects, and incorporating WGS variants could, in principle, improve polygenic score prediction accuracy.",
  "In mammals, robust epigenetic reprogramming in the germ line and early embryo largely erases acquired epigenetic marks, making demonstrated transgenerational epigenetic inheritance across multiple generations rare and unlikely, with limited support for impacts on human health.",
  "The paper emphasizes that narrow-sense heritability is additive; non-additive genetic interactions and GxE do not contribute to it, and stably inherited epigenetic effects would behave like sequence variants in LD with SNPs; thus, the shortfall of SNP-explained variance relative to heritability is attributed mainly to small effect sizes and incomplete LD rather than to dominance or epistasis.",
  "Across empirical data and theoretical models, the authors conclude that additive genetic variance usually constitutes the majority of total genetic variance for complex traits; under realistic (U-shaped) allele frequency distributions, most variance appears additive even when dominance and epistasis occur, and GWAS should primarily detect additive gene-substitution effects while gene-gene interactions explain a smaller share of variance.",
  "In a panel of Arabidopsis epiRILs derived from near-isogenic parents differing primarily in DNA methylation, numerous epialleles were stably transmitted for at least eight generations and were associated with measurable broad-sense heritability (~30%) for complex traits (flowering time and plant height), indicating that heritable phenotypic variation can arise from epigenetic differences independent of DNA sequence polymorphisms.",
  "Under this framework, the variance in a trait explained by a polygenic score is limited by the genetic variance captured by the marker panel (bounded by heritability); with increasing training sample size, prediction accuracy approaches a ceiling determined by that explained variance, and with whole-genome coverage this ceiling corresponds to the narrow-sense heritability.",
  "Heritability sets an upper bound on the utility of genetic risk prediction, while SNP heritability specifically reflects additive effects from common variants (excluding dominance, epistasis, and poorly tagged or rare variants) and thus quantifies the proportion of variance that could be explained by common-variant GWAS.",
  "GWAS-based, linearly summed polygenic predictions and LMM-KGCV heritability estimates capture only the additive genetic variance tagged by the measured SNPs; for unrelated individuals, untagged (e.g., rare) causal variants and non-additive effects (dominance, epistasis) do not contribute, so the KGCV estimate bounds the maximum variance explainable by that SNP set and serves as a lower bound on total narrow-sense heritability.",
  "The paper identifies a significant positive heat capacity change during DNA melting (DCp ≈ 40–100 cal/mol·K per base pair), notes that prior bulk melting analyses often assumed temperature-independent DH and DS due to historical calorimetric limitations, and explains that because a = DCp/DS0 > 1, DH and DS exhibit strong temperature dependence even when DG and Tm change only weakly.",
  "The paper states that analyses of DNA melting typically assume zero heat-capacity change (ΔCp=0), but incorporating a significant increase in heat capacity during melting reconciles discrepancies in nearest-neighbor enthalpy and entropy parameters and aligns conventional assumptions with experimental data.",
  "DNA denaturation in bulk measurements consists of many overlapping sub-transitions from heterogeneous domains, complicating the determination of individual equilibrium states and accurate thermodynamic parameters; this study addresses the issue by engineering plasmids with discrete, sharply melting domains to isolate transitions.",
  "Calorimetric studies indicate that large, nonzero heat capacity changes (ACp) are common in biopolymer reactions, and when ACp is large, entropy becomes strongly temperature-dependent, implying that thermodynamic parameters can vary with temperature rather than remain constant.",
  "The study’s bulk DSC and UV analyses enforce two-state melting for oligomers and describe cooperative melting units for polymers, and within the measured systems detect no significant heat capacity changes, leading to temperature-independent enthalpy values for the reported nearest-neighbor parameters.",
  "Bulk polymer melting data have intrinsic constraints: heterogeneous (natural) sequences exhibit non-two-state melting requiring partition-function analyses, and the stacking matrix for polymers has rank 8 (only eight invariants), making any 10-parameter nearest-neighbor fit from polymer data fundamentally non-unique even under ideal experimental conditions.",
  "The paper highlights a core limitation of bulk melting (optical or calorimetric) approaches: they require prior knowledge of ΔH and extrapolation of measured ΔG to a reference temperature, a step that significantly reduces the precision of ΔG for oligonucleotide duplexes; the authors propose a FRET-based competition assay that directly yields ΔG at the desired temperature.",
  "The paper demonstrates that nucleic acid duplex melting involves a positive heat capacity change (average DCP ≈ 64.6 ± 21.4 cal deg−1 mol−1 as measured by DSC), contradicting the longstanding assumption of DCP = 0 in thermodynamic datasets and showing that comparisons of enthalpies across temperatures are invalid without accounting for DCP.",
  "Weber (1978) demonstrates that CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) forms a cubic perovskite structure at ambient conditions with lattice parameters a = 5.68 Å (Cl), 5.92 Å (Br), and 6.27 Å (I), confirming via powder XRD and noting that methylammonium is structurally compatible with the Pb(II) halide octahedral framework, while CsPbX3 perovskites were at that time known only as high-temperature phases.",
  "This paper identifies methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA) as established organic A-site cations for lead-halide perovskites and reports that aziridinium (AZ) forms stable AZPbX3 perovskite compounds; it further notes AZPbBr3 has a Goldschmidt tolerance factor of 0.95, consistent with APbBr3 perovskite formability.",
  "Within hybrid iodide perovskites, the paper reports that methylammonium and formamidinium independently form three-dimensional lead iodide perovskites (MAPbI3 and FAPbI3), while ethylammonium lead iodide (EAPbI3) does not form a perovskite; acetamidinium forms perovskites with Ge(II), not demonstrated with Pb(II) in this work.",
  "The paper demonstrates that CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) adopts a cubic perovskite structure with specified lattice parameters, while noting that in the APbX3 (lead-halide) system the perovskite form of CsPbX3 was known only as a high-temperature modification.",
  "This paper focuses on the all-inorganic A-site cation Cs in CsPbBr3 perovskites and describes their three-dimensional corner-sharing PbBr6 framework (orthorhombic Pbnm at room temperature), explicitly distinguishing these materials from hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites but not enumerating any organic A-site cations.",
  "This paper reports that three-dimensional APbX3 lead halide perovskites have been synthesized with several small organic A-site cations, specifically methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), methylhydrazinium (MHy+), and aziridinium (AZR+), with the AZRPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) family confirmed as stable.",
  "According to this paper, three-dimensional lead halide perovskite structures have been identified for methylammonium, formamidinium, and methylhydrazinium cations, and have also been reported for aziridinium cations (AZPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) that crystallize in cubic Pm3m symmetry at room temperature.",
  "The paper highlights hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites MAPbX3, explicitly identifying the organic A-site cation as methylammonium (CH3NH3+), and contrasts them with all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites that are isostructural to CaTiO3.",
  "This paper establishes that 3D hybrid perovskites generally form when the tolerance factor is between 0.8 and 1.0, confirms methylammonium lead iodide as a well-characterized hybrid perovskite, and shows that ethylammonium lead iodide is low-dimensional (1D chains), indicating that some larger organic A-site cations do not independently form 3D lead halide perovskites.",
  "This paper explicitly includes methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) as an experimentally realized perovskite and correctly predicts its stability, but states that only inorganic A-site cations were used in developing the descriptor, indicating the work does not comprehensively survey organic A-site cations beyond the illustrative use of methylammonium.",
  "The review states that only the initial linear portion of a progress curve should be used for velocity determination and that the reaction rate is directly proportional to enzyme concentration; accordingly, adjusting enzyme amount (decreasing if the reaction is too fast or increasing if too slow) is a primary method to obtain a clear, adequately long linear phase, with reductions in enzyme extending the linear window and preventing the reaction from finishing before recording.",
  "Lowering temperature (cryoenzymic conditions) can shift the rate-limiting step and produce multiphasic progress curves (e.g., triphasic at –15 °C), and varying temperature across a broad range is an established strategy to probe and interpret such kinetic behaviors.",
  "The manual advises preserving linear initial velocity conditions by reducing enzyme concentration when progress curves plateau early, maintaining constant temperature by equilibrating all reagents, and recognizing that obligate dimer enzymes can lose activity upon large dilution into assay buffer, potentially impacting observed reaction linearity.",
  "- The review explains that early product formation in enzyme reactions is linear but difficult to capture with manual timing, and describes an air-segmented sequential injection setup that prevents premature mixing and dispersion so real-time initial-state rates can be measured accurately.",
  "The study recommends running assays at 37 °C to mimic physiological conditions and adjusting enzyme concentration to secure a sustained linear reaction phase with <10–15% substrate depletion, noting that the model enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) is a homodimer requiring Zn2+ and Mg2+ at its catalytic site.",
  "The review highlights that kinetic behavior depends on experimental conditions: temperature and pH can alter interaction rates, and simplifying bimolecular kinetics by using at least a ten-fold excess of one reactant (pseudo–first-order conditions) enables linear kobs-versus-concentration relationships; in multistep reactions, varying reagent concentrations and comparing single- versus double-exponential fits can reveal fast linear and slower non-linear components.",
  "The review establishes that hemoglobin has four binding centers and presents Adair’s formulation, where the partition function 1 + 4K1x + 6K2x2 + 4K3x3 + K4x4 and the reinterpretation of the Hill coefficient n as the number of monomers (tetramer) together reflect a valency of four.",
  "In the canonical total binding framework, n denotes the number of ligand-binding sites, and stepwise macroscopic association constants (Adair–Klotz K1, K2, …) quantify successive ligand additions to receptors with 0, 1, … bound ligands; these constants map onto the binding polynomial coefficients (e.g., p1 = K1, p2 = K1K2), linking stepwise binding to the polynomial form.",
  "In multisubunit binding, the experimentally determined stepwise Kd values are macroscopic (aggregate) constants that average over all species transitioning between stoichiometric states; when the protein has n equivalent, independent sites, these stepwise dissociation constants are constrained by statistical factors reflecting site equivalence.",
  "Under the assumption of equivalent, independent sites, the stepwise macroscopic binding constants relate to the intrinsic site constant via combinatorial factors: for univalent ligands binding to a p-valent acceptor, the number of arrangements is (p – i + 1)/i for the ith binding step (defining Ki relative to k), and for bivalent ligands an additional factor of 2 accounts for two ways of attachment per arrangement.",
  "Stoichiometric (macroscopic) binding constants K1, K2, … can be directly obtained from binding data and remain well-defined regardless of site interactions, and the total number of such constants is determined by the total number of binding sites (valency).",
  "The paper defines vaccine efficacy as the percent reduction in disease incidence among vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups and provides both a basic attack-rate formula and a screening equation relating the proportion of cases vaccinated (PCV) and the proportion of the population vaccinated (PPV) to VE, enabling VE estimation when only coverage and case vaccination data are available.",
  "The screening method estimates vaccine effectiveness by comparing the proportion vaccinated among cases (PCV) with the proportion vaccinated in the population (PPV); in this framework, PCV is defined as the proportion of cases fully vaccinated and PPV as the proportion of the population fully vaccinated, enabling VE estimation from routine surveillance data even without linked datasets.",
  "The paper defines the herd immunity threshold as 1–1/R0 and, for SARS-CoV-2 with R0=3, states the threshold is approximately 67%, noting this basic model assumes homogeneous mixing and sterilizing immunity that prevents onward transmission.",
  "The paper states that the critical proportion of a population that must be immune to halt transmission is Pcrit = 1 − (1/Rt), exemplified by Rt = 3 implying Pcrit = 0.67 (about two-thirds of the population); it also explains that Rt equals R0 multiplied by the susceptible fraction, highlighting how existing immunity reduces transmission.",
  "The screening method relates vaccine effectiveness (VE), proportion of the population vaccinated (PPV), and proportion of cases vaccinated (PCV), allowing estimation of VE via VE = 1 – [PCV/(1–PCV)]/[PPV/(1–PPV)] and, by the basic efficacy definition, VE = 1 – (attack rate in vaccinated/attack rate in unvaccinated); knowing any two of VE, PPV, and PCV enables calculation of the third.",
  "The study provides a quantitative method to calculate vaccine coverage needed for herd immunity: define the herd immunity threshold as Ic = 1 − (1/Ro), compute the critical vaccination coverage as Vc = [1 − (1/Ro)]/E, and if a proportion r of vaccinated individuals becomes infected and infectious, adjust to Vc = Ic/(E − r), linking required coverage to virus transmissibility (Ro), vaccine effectiveness (E), and breakthrough infection proportion (r).",
  "The screening method estimates vaccine effectiveness from aggregate data by relating the proportion vaccinated among cases (PCV) to the overall population vaccination coverage (PPV); 1−VE corresponds to the odds ratio of vaccination in cases versus the population, enabling logistic regression with the logit of PPV as an offset, and making the approach suitable for timely VE monitoring in low-resource or urgent decision-making contexts.",
  "Aldehydes and ketones show a strong IR absorption for the carbonyl group in the 1660–1770 cm−1 region; aldehydes additionally display characteristic C–H absorptions at 2700–2760 and 2800–2860 cm−1, while in 13C NMR the carbonyl carbon resonates at 190–215 δ, with saturated aldehyde/ketone carbons typically appearing at 200–215 δ.",
  "The study establishes a Lewis acid-catalyzed Prins/pinacol cascade that furnishes 7-substituted-8-oxaspiro[4.5]decan-1-one ketonic spirocycles, with products verified by IR and NMR analyses.",
  "Pinacol rearrangement can proceed via a stepwise pathway where H2O departs first followed by 1,2-migration, and polar solvents favor this stepwise route by promoting water departure, consistent with strongly acidic, polar conditions.",
  "Semipinacol rearrangement is a 1,2-migration from an oxygen-bearing carbon to an adjacent electrophilic center that typically forms a carbonyl (ketone/aldehyde), can be initiated under acidic conditions via an α-hydroxy carbocation, and is broadly applied to construct quaternary centers and remodel carbocyclic frameworks through ring expansions or contractions.",
  "The paper states that 13C NMR chemical shifts for common metabolites span roughly 10–222 ppm, with ketone carbons appearing near ~222 ppm; this wide range makes 13C shifts highly diagnostic and particularly useful for identifying functional groups such as carbonyls.",
  "The paper highlights that 13C NMR chemical shifts span ~10 ppm for aliphatic methyl carbons to ~222 ppm for a ketone carbonyl (e.g., butanone), a ~20-fold wider range than 1H shifts, making 13C shifts highly diagnostic for identifying functional groups and aiding metabolite structure determination.",
  "Semipinacol rearrangements generate carbonyl-containing products via 1,2-migration from oxygenated carbons and can remodel carbocycle frameworks, exemplified by converting a trans-octahydronaphthalene into an octahydroindene bearing an aldehyde functionality through an epoxidation/semipinacol ring-contraction sequence.",
  "The study shows that a Nazarov cyclization can generate a carbocation that triggers a semipinacol rearrangement to form spiro[4.4]nonane-1,6-diones, while related systems have been observed to undergo dehydration to alkylidenecyclopentenones instead of the rearrangement product.",
  "MBP is a broadly effective fusion partner for improving solubility of aggregation-prone proteins in E. coli; notably, proteins such as GFP, p16, and E6 that are insoluble at 37°C become efficiently soluble when fused to MBP, and MBP has been shown to consistently outperform other highly soluble fusion partners in promoting solubility.",
  "Dynamic light scattering of recombinant factor VIII resolved monomer or small oligomer species with hydrodynamic radius 7–30 nm and large aggregate species 50–1000 nm and higher aggregate content was associated with reduced in vitro pharmacodynamic activity.",
  "- The study demonstrates that MBP is an unusually effective solubilizing fusion partner compared to GST and TRX, that lowering expression temperature increases solubility of fusion proteins, and that MBP fusion can promote proper folding to an active state in at least some cases (e.g., TEV protease).",
  "Dynamic light scattering (DLS) reports hydrodynamic radius (Rh) derived from Brownian motion, and while monomeric proteins typically have hydrodynamic diameters in the ~5–20 nm range (e.g., BSA ~7 nm, IgG ~12–14 nm), DLS outputs are semi-quantitative and intensity-weighted such that larger species can mask the signal from smaller species like monomers.",
  "In DLS, intensity-weighted size distributions scale roughly with the sixth power of particle size, making intensity analyses highly sensitive to trace high-molecular-weight aggregates (which may be invisible in volume distributions); thus, intensity distributions are recommended for detecting small amounts of aggregates, whereas volume distributions better reflect overall sample homogeneity.",
  "The study reports that mammalian expression—specifically HEK293-6E—supports advanced folding, secretion, and post-translational processing needed for high-quality antibodies, and demonstrates robust transient production reaching up to 600 mg/L of scFv-Fc antibodies using optimized vectors and fed-batch cultivation.",
  "Cultivating E. coli at reduced temperatures limits in vivo aggregation and improves solubility; co-expressing the Hsp70-family chaperone DnaK can prevent inclusion bodies by reducing aggregation; and fusing targets to MBP (or NusA) is a potent strategy to enhance solubility, particularly for aggregation-prone proteins.",
  "Lowering expression temperature is a common tactic to enhance solubility, while co-expression of the E. coli Hsp70 homolog DnaK can prevent aggregation but may produce inconsistent outcomes, including improved soluble fractions accompanied by reduced yield and compromised conformational quality due to soluble aggregate formation.",
  "Inclusion bodies in E. coli are not necessarily inactive; studies cited here show GFP and various enzymes embedded in IBs retain measurable activity, and IB formation can be influenced by parameters such as culture temperature and the overexpression of folding modulators.",
  "GFP engineering has produced variants with enhanced folding (e.g., F64L improves eGFP folding at 37°C) and superfolder GFP, which have been used as N-terminal fusion tags to report on partner folding and to stabilize or increase solubility of otherwise difficult proteins.",
  "Lowering expression temperature in E. coli reduces aggregation and can improve protein quality; co-expressing or elevating the Hsp70-family chaperone DnaK enhances conformational quality; and using MBP as an N-terminal fusion partner increases solubility due to its intrinsic chaperone activity.",
  "Human 293 (HEK293-derived) cells, particularly 293E, are widely used for transient recombinant protein production and can yield active proteins with relevant post-translational modifications, achieving high intracellular expression levels (up to 50 mg/l, ~20% of total cellular proteins) using PEI-mediated transfection.",
  "The paper notes that altering expression conditions (e.g., temperature) and using solubility-enhancing fusion partners are common strategies to improve apparent solubility, illustrates temperature sensitivity with a protein variant that is soluble at 27uC but insoluble at 37uC, and emphasizes that such strategies do not increase intrinsic folding stability; additionally, superfolder GFP serves as a robust folding reporter rather than directly aiding folding of upstream proteins.",
  "GFP’s folding involves a dual-basin energy landscape with a fast initial folding step and a slow chromophore-linked locking transition that causes hysteresis; eliminating the chromophore restores typical reversible thermodynamics.",
  "MAPKAPK2 directly phosphorylates 14-3-3 zeta at Ser-58; this modification (and the S58D phosphomimetic) disrupts dimerization and diminishes Raf-1 binding, with experiments showing phosphorylation shifts 14-3-3 from mostly dimer to an approximately equal monomer–dimer distribution.",
  "SEC-MALS is an absolute method that can determine protein molar mass and complex stoichiometry, assess whether an eluting peak is homogeneous or reflects a dynamic equilibrium, and has been used to show condition-dependent oligomerization (e.g., apo NEET proteins are monomers while holo forms are dimers).",
  "PP2A is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase whose dephosphorylation activity is widespread and essential, with substrate specificity governed by B regulatory subunit composition, subcellular localization, interactions with endogenous inhibitors, and direct intermolecular contacts with substrates.",
  "SEC-MALS and complementary binding assays demonstrate that the NuRD deacetylase module consists of a dimeric HDAC1:MTA1 core that binds only one MBD2 (2:2:1 stoichiometry), with MBD2 engagement dependent on the MTA1 dimerization interface.",
  "SEC-MALS combines size-based SEC separation with multi-angle light scattering and a concentration detector (UV or RI) to deliver absolute molecular weight, size/shape, and improved detection of higher-order aggregates; relying on SEC calibration alone can misestimate protein MW due to shape differences and nonideal adsorption affecting retention.",
  "SEC-MALS measured a ~338 ± 22 kDa CYP2B4:POR complex in amphipols consistent with a 2:2 tetramer plus an APol particle, with a largely homogeneous mass profile under the main SEC peak and minor early-eluting heterogeneity; chemical crosslinking stabilized the assembly into a >460 kDa high-mass species, supporting a tightly associated multiunit complex.",
  "Phosphorylation of Bad by PAK1 at Ser112 and Ser136 switches its binding partners by weakening interaction with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and enabling association with 14-3-3t, demonstrating that phosphorylation can modulate protein complex composition and influence cell survival signaling.",
  "Human ERα is phosphorylated by PKA at Ser236 in the DNA-binding domain; this phosphorylation (or an S236E substitution) inhibits receptor dimerization and DNA binding in the absence of ligand, while estrogen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen can restore dimerization via the ligand-binding domain, whereas ICI 182,780 does not.",
  "Large-scale phosphomimetic screening identified 248 phosphosites that modulate motif-based interactions, with approximately equal frequencies of enabling and disabling effects, and a validated case showed phosphorylation of HURP at Ser839 increases its affinity for clathrin N-terminal domain by ~20-fold.",
  "SEC-MALS enables determination of absolute complex stoichiometry and oligomeric states by measuring molecular mass across chromatographic peaks; flat MW traces indicate homogeneous species, and matching measured to theoretical mass can confirm specific oligomeric forms (e.g., identifying a stable homodimer).",
  "Phosphorylation, especially on tyrosines, can create SH2-binding docking sites and substantially increase binding affinity—often by orders of magnitude—primarily by enhancing association rate constants through added negative charges that strengthen electrostatic attraction.",
  "SEC-MALS measured 100–140 kDa masses for GPIHBP1•LPL•Fab complexes, supporting a 1:1:1 stoichiometry; SEC-MALS also observed a 1:1 LPL•GPIHBP1 complex, and together with SEC-SAXS confirmed that Fab-5D2 disrupts LPL homodimers to yield monomers under the tested conditions.",
  "Protein–protein binding affinity increases with larger buried interface area (DASA) and decreases with greater conformational change at the interface (iRMSD); a minimal two-feature model predicts Kd within three orders of magnitude for 88% of benchmarked complexes but performs poorly for cases dominated by large conformational changes or strong electrostatic contributions.",
  "Overexpression of SH2 domains increases tyrosine phosphorylation at their target motifs by protecting bound phosphotyrosines from dephosphorylation; this effect is dose-dependent and aligned with the binding specificity of the SH2 domain, as demonstrated by experiments and supported by computational modeling.",
  "CeF6²⁻ exhibits significantly greater Ce 4f–F 2p overlap (S4f,avg² = 0.016(2)) than CeCl6²⁻ (S4f,avg² = 0.0058(6)), yet shows about 25% less 4f covalent mixing and lower ligand-to-metal donation, attributed to a larger Ce 4f–F 2p energy gap (∼8.2 eV vs ∼3.7 eV), placing CeF6²⁻ among the most ionic Ce(IV) compounds studied.",
  "In f-element complexes, the energetic stabilization associated with covalency depends predominantly on metal–ligand orbital overlap (H), so even when ligand p- and metal f-orbitals show comparable mixing, greater overlap yields stronger covalent bond contributions, whereas reduced overlap leads to weaker covalent stabilization.",
  "In lanthanide complexes, covalency (extent of metal–ligand electronic delocalization) is governed by both orbital overlap and the metal–ligand energy gap; strong overlap increases covalency (nephelauxetic effect), while small energy mismatches can also maximize covalent mixing even when overlap is minimal.",
  "Covalent bonding in f-element complexes is driven by mixing of overlapping metal–ligand AOs and is enhanced when AO energies are well matched; in early f-block systems, both overlap and energy alignment control the degree of covalency (energy degeneracy alone is insufficient), and Ce(IV) compounds are notable cases where 4f orbitals can contribute appreciably to covalent bonding.",
  "The paper states that covalent bonding in f-element complexes involves both orbital overlap and energetic matching; mere near-degeneracy-driven canonical AO mixing without significant overlap does not yield stabilization or stronger covalency, so canonical mixing alone is not a reliable measure of covalency.",
  "In Ce(IV) multiple-bond complexes, imido Ce=N bonds are significantly more covalent (WBI ≈ 1.76) than oxo Ce=O bonds (WBI ≈ 1.34), yet both involve hybrid Ce acceptor orbitals with approximately 60% f and 40% d character; more generally, stronger hybridization of Ce 4f with ligand 2p and Ce 5d orbitals is associated with increased f-electron delocalization.",
  "SHELXT determines space groups by first solving in P1 and then testing all space groups in the specified Laue group against the derived phases; weak reflections contribute to distinguishing solutions even when systematic absences are not used.",
  "A low value of \u00050 (below ~0.3) is a diagnostic suggesting a centrosymmetric space group; when multiple plausible solutions exist, the highest-symmetry (often centrosymmetric) space group is commonly correct.",
  "Z′ denotes the count of symmetry-independent molecules in the asymmetric unit; high Z′ (>1) structures are uncommon (~10% of CSD as of June 2023) and typically arise from competing intermolecular interactions of similar strength.",
  "Enantiomerically pure chiral compounds are expected to crystallize in Sohncke space groups; in space group P21 (with two general positions), asymmetric unit contents must respect this constraint, and having an odd distribution of conformers can necessitate higher Z′ due to the lack of additional symmetry.",
  "The paper argues that restraint-based least-squares refinements should be critically examined, while constraint-based methods using internal coordinates provide a more robust framework for structural analysis.",
  "Constraint-based refinements reduce the number of adjustable parameters and thereby improve the reliability and convergence of crystal structure refinements, especially in cases with many parameters and limited data.",
  "The review states that mouse Braveheart lncRNA is essential for cardiovascular lineage commitment, is required for embryonic stem cells to acquire cardiac fate and differentiate into cardiomyocytes, and supports fetal/neonatal cardiomyocyte homeostasis, without providing explicit quantitative expression-change data in these cell types.",
  "Braveheart (Bvht) is a lncRNA essential for cardiac lineage commitment in mouse embryonic stem cells, functioning upstream of MESP1 and interacting with PRC2; its AGIL structural motif binds CNBP, and deletion of AGIL impairs cardiogenic differentiation.",
  "In mouse ESCs, the Bvht AGIL-deletion mutant is expressed at wild-type–comparable levels, but during cardiomyocyte differentiation this mutation prevents activation of key cardiac transcription factors and contractile genes, indicating stage-specific downstream expression defects despite unchanged Bvht transcript levels in ESCs.",
  "During directed differentiation from embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes, both coding genes and long noncoding RNAs exhibit distinct, stage-specific expression patterns, with lncRNAs showing striking stage-specific expression across ESC, MES, CP, and CM stages.",
  "Bvht (Braveheart) shows predominant expression in embryonic stem cells and heart tissue and becomes enriched during cardiac differentiation, with markedly higher levels in MesP1-positive and NKX2.5-positive cardiac progenitor populations.",
  "Carbamazepine can induce hyponatremia through increased ADH secretion, heightened renal tubular responsiveness to ADH, and increased aquaporin-2 expression; clinically, hyponatremia may be subtle in presentation with dizziness or somnolence but can progress to seizures if acute.",
  "In this review, topiramate is linked to confusion, dizziness, somnolence, and visual problems, while lamotrigine increases rash incidence compared with placebo (7% vs 2%), indicating notable cognitive and cutaneous adverse-effect profiles with these agents.",
  "Lamotrigine undergoes hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase–mediated N-2 glucuronidation (primarily by UGT1A4 and UGT2B7) to form lamotrigine-N-2-glucuronide, the main metabolite excreted in urine; inhibition of this glucuronidation pathway (e.g., by valproic acid) is a recognized mechanism affecting lamotrigine disposition.",
  "Lamotrigine is eliminated mainly by UGT-mediated N-glucuronidation (primarily UGT1A4, with UGT2B7 contribution), and coadministration of valproate inhibits these UGTs, increasing lamotrigine exposure by about two-fold, with higher concentrations associated with a rapidly increasing risk of serious adverse events.",
  "In elderly patients, many antiepileptic drugs (including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, gabapentin, phenytoin, and topiramate) can cause hyponatremia—often within the first few weeks of therapy—and even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment and gait/fall disturbances.",
  "Co-administration of valproic acid inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation, diverting metabolism to cytochrome P450-mediated bioactivation and formation of a reactive arene oxide; if detoxification via epoxide hydrolase and/or glutathione pathways is impaired (e.g., by VPA-induced enzyme inhibition or glutathione depletion), arene oxide accumulation can cause adverse cutaneous reactions.",
  "In epilepsy RCTs, retention rate is used as a proxy for combined effectiveness because discontinuations are assumed to occur from inadequate seizure control or adverse side effects, thereby capturing both efficacy and tolerability in one measure.",
  "Lamotrigine is primarily cleared by UGT1A4-mediated glucuronidation, and valproic acid strongly inhibits UGT isoenzymes; when coadministered, valproic acid reduces lamotrigine elimination, doubling its half-life and increasing serum levels by over 200%.",
  "In a 4-week controlled blind inpatient study of acute mania, sodium valproate was as effective as lithium; valproate was initiated with a 20 mg/kg loading dose and used in the 600–1400 mg/day range, and one patient on valproate developed hepatitis.",
  "Psychotropic agents and certain anticonvulsants can directly activate renal V2 receptors, increasing cAMP and AQP2 expression without vasopressin (NSIAD), with hyponatremia often appearing within weeks of therapy initiation; chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and increased falls.",
  "In a 12-week randomized open-label trial of bipolar I mania, combining valproate with haloperidol resulted in a higher overall rate of treatment-emergent adverse events than valproate with amisulpride; notably, one haloperidol-treated patient discontinued due to a rash.",
  "Lamotrigine undergoes a minor cytochrome P450-mediated bioactivation (primarily by CYP2A6 and CYP2D6) to a reactive arene oxide on its dichlorophenyl ring; the resulting arene-oxide–derived reactive metabolites form glutathione thioether adducts and have been observed in keratinocytes, where they may contribute to lamotrigine-associated skin rashes and severe cutaneous reactions.",
  "In SANAD, topiramate was particularly associated with cognitive and psychiatric adverse effects (e.g., depression, memory disturbance), while rash was notably more common with carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine (and a frequent reason for treatment failure), with lower rash rates observed for lamotrigine.",
  "In pediatric trials for focal-onset seizures, cutaneous adverse effects are documented across multiple AEDs: lamotrigine reported rash in 16.3% of patients, oxcarbazepine had cases where rash caused treatment discontinuation, and topiramate reported rash in 12% of patients, indicating that several commonly used agents carry notable risks of skin reactions.",
  "In SJS, drug-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells initiate epithelial injury via perforin/granzyme B–mediated apoptosis, which is subsequently amplified through Fas–Fas ligand interactions.",
  "Lithium therapy commonly causes thyroid dysfunction—especially hypothyroidism—through inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis and release and reduced peripheral deiodination, with reported prevalence of hypothyroidism/subclinical hypothyroidism up to 52% among treated patients.",
  "Iatrogenic arsenic trioxide therapy can rapidly produce Mees’ lines, first appearing on a single fingernail within a week and spreading to multiple fingernails over 10–14 days, characterized by a transverse broad white band.",
  "Lithium maintenance therapy is strongly linked to hypothyroidism; guidelines recommend routine thyroid function monitoring during lithium treatment and managing lithium-associated hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone supplementation rather than stopping lithium.",
  "A Swedish copper smelter case-referent study found that workers exposed to trivalent arsenic had markedly elevated mortality from lung cancer (~5-fold) and cardiovascular disease (~2-fold) with dose-response to exposure, along with slight increases in malignant blood diseases and cirrhosis of the liver, in a mixed exposure setting that also included sulphur dioxide and copper.",
  "Copper smelter workers experienced measurable inhalation exposures to inorganic arsenic (e.g., ~0.29–11.3 mg/m3 depending on work area), and absorbed arsenic is primarily excreted via the kidneys as reflected by urinary arsenic, linking occupational airborne exposure to systemic elimination pathways.",
  "This systematic review reports that arsenic exposure—including via occupational inhalation—is linked to kidney disease outcomes, with evidence ranging from increased albuminuria/proteinuria to dose-response associations with CKD and elevated kidney disease mortality in exposed populations.",
  "Arsenic exposure is closely linked to renal outcomes: the kidney is the primary organ for arsenic excretion, occupational arsenic exposure (e.g., in smelter workers) is associated with increased proteinuria, and reducing arsenic in drinking water has been followed by decreases in kidney disease mortality.",
  "In a cohort of American Indian adults, urinary arsenic (sum of inorganic and methylated species) showed a positive prospective association with incident chronic kidney disease (adjusted HR 1.2 per interquartile increase), with monomethylarsonate and dimethylarsinate each showing HRs of 1.2; kidneys are the primary route for arsenic elimination, underscoring renal involvement in arsenic exposure.",
  "Chronic arsenic exposure—documented in industrial settings such as smelter work—leads to arsenic accumulation in the kidneys and has been associated with increased mortality from nephritis and higher risks of urinary tract cancers, indicating renal involvement in arsenic toxicity.",
  "BH3 is identified as a competent borane catalyst for hydroboration of alkenes, with a proposed mechanism involving initial alkene hydroboration by the borane followed by transborylation to form an alkylboronic ester and regenerate the catalyst.",
  "Hydroboration–oxidation of alkenes proceeds via anti-Markovnikov, cis addition to form borane intermediates that are oxidized to alcohols; terminal alkenes give terminal alcohols with complete selectivity, and oxidation is carried out using aqueous NaOH and H2O2.",
  "Strong Lewis bases tend to favor E2 over SN2 because E2 benefits more from increased electron-donating capability; solvation lowers the base HOMO and shifts the preference toward SN2 by increasing the E2 barrier more than the SN2 barrier, with stronger solvent polarity amplifying this shift.",
  "The paper establishes that alcohols are efficiently converted to alkyl bromides, with phosphorus tribromide specifically recommended (and often superior to red phosphorus/bromine) for preparing secondary and tertiary alkyl bromides to avoid side reactions such as dehydration.",
  "Phosphorus tribromide converts alcohols into alkyl bromides; this is illustrated by forming isobutyl bromide from isobutyl alcohol, and the method is noted to give purer products and better yields than hydrobromic acid/sulfuric acid approaches.",
  "The paper demonstrates that treating β-ethoxyethyl alcohol with phosphorus tribromide produces β-ethoxyethyl bromide, confirming the use of PBr3 to convert an alcohol to its corresponding alkyl bromide, with the bromide isolated as a distinct lower layer and purified by distillation.",
  "Hydroboration–oxidation converts alkenes to alcohols with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity and syn addition of H and OH; GC data for 1-methylcyclohexene showed >99% anti-Markovnikov product formation, empirically confirming this selectivity.",
  "The paper defines HRV as beat-to-beat variation in heart rate or in the duration of the R–R interval (heart period), and specifies that time-domain HRV analyses commonly use the normal-to-normal (NN) interval, defined as the interval between adjacent normal QRS complexes.",
  "The study explicitly names the beat-to-beat values used to derive variability metrics as interbeat intervals (IBIs) and R–R intervals (RRIs), with PRV described as the time difference between pulse-to-pulse cycles measured from PPG and HRV derived from ECG R-peak intervals.",
  "[The paper defines HRV as variability in the time intervals between heartbeats, naming these intervals interbeat intervals (IBIs); it further explains that the IBI is the time between successive heartbeats, with NN intervals referring to artifact-free IBIs and RR intervals referring to IBIs between all successive heartbeats.].",
  "In this study, the time between consecutive PPG peaks is explicitly termed the RR-interval, and HRV feature calculations (e.g., RMSSD, pNN50) are described as being based on successive NN intervals.",
  "The interval between successive heartbeats is termed heart period (HP), synonymous with interbeat interval (IBI) and R–R interval, and an HP time series can be derived from PPG beat-to-beat blood volume pulse signals; HRV reflects beat-to-beat variability in HP.",
  "In this study, HRV derived from PPG-captured beat-to-beat intervals was computed as the root mean square of successive differences (rMSSD) between heartbeats, a widely used time-domain index of vagal tone.",
  "The paper investigates drug permeation across Calu-3 airway epithelial monolayers using manual aerosol devices (MicroSprayer IA-1C for liquids and DP-4 Dry Powder Insufflator for powders) to evaluate formulation effects and drug–drug interactions in fixed-dose combinations; it does not involve cardiovascular measurements or HR/HRV analysis.",
  "In PPG-based PRV analysis, the beat-to-beat interval used for variability computation is called the peak-to-peak interval (PPI); after removing outlier intervals, the cleaned series is referred to as the normal-to-normal interval (NNI).",
  "In this study, HRV derived from a PPG-based wristband was computed as rMSSD (root mean square difference between successive heartbeats), and device outputs included BPM and HRV per successful sample.",
  "The paper states that only non-centrosymmetric point groups host certain optical phenomena (e.g., NLO and EO), and it classifies the 32 crystal classes into 11 centrosymmetric and 21 non-centrosymmetric, noting that 10 of these are polar (and thus non-centrosymmetric).",
  "Optical activity in crystals arises from non-centrosymmetric symmetry; at optical wavelengths both the pseudo-scalar and pseudo-deviator invariants can contribute, but in achiral classes the pseudo-scalar vanishes, so only those achiral, non-polar classes with a non-zero pseudo-deviator (as indicated in the paper’s Table 1) possess the correct symmetry for optical activity.",
  "According to the paper, X-ray natural circular dichroism (XNCD)—an expression of optical activity—requires non-centrosymmetric crystal symmetry and, in the X-ray regime, predominantly originates from electric-dipole–electric-quadrupole (E1:E2) interference associated with the pseudodeviator part of the gyrotropy tensor.",
  "Optical activity is treated as an axial second‑rank tensor that is forbidden in centrosymmetric crystals; in a specific symmetry-reduction example under an electric field along [111], the resulting point group PF = 3 is described as optically active, whereas PF = 3m is described as not optically active.",
  "Among the non-enantiomorphous classes where optical activity may occur (m, mm2, 4, 42m), m, mm2, and 4 are polar classes, whereas 42m is not listed as polar; therefore 42m is the only achiral, non-polar class with symmetry permitting optical activity according to this source.",
  "The paper enumerates symmetry classifications crucial for assessing optical-activity eligibility: it lists the 11 rotation-only (chiral) noncentrosymmetric point groups {1, 2, 222, 4, 422, 3, 32, 6, 622, 23, 432}, the ten noncentrosymmetric but achiral point groups containing second-kind operations {m, mm2, 4¯, 4¯2m, 4mm, 3m, 6¯, 6¯m2, 6mm, 4¯3m}, and separately identifies polar classes where the origin cannot be fixed {1, 2, m, mm2, 4, 4mm, 3, 3m, 6, 6mm}.",
  "- The paper specifies which geometric crystal classes are chiral (enantiomorphous: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 32, 622, 23, 432) and which are polar (pyroelectric: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm), enabling identification of achiral and non-polar classes by exclusion from these lists.",
  "The paper enumerates the 10 polar point groups (1, 2, m, mm2, 4, 4mm, 3, 3m, 6, 6mm) and notes that there are 11 centrosymmetric and 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups overall, with several optical effects restricted to non-centrosymmetric classes.",
  "The paper establishes that only non-centrosymmetric classes can be optically active, identifies that only 13 such classes possess the pseudo-deviator needed for XNCD, notes that 432 and 23 are optically active in the visible but not in XNCD, and shows that the achiral class mm2 exhibits gyrotropy with directional constraints.",
  "According to the paper’s PT-symmetry-based analysis, circular birefringence is expected in classes 1, 2, 222, 4, 4mm, 3, 3m, 6, and 6mm (due to non-vanishing antisymmetric axial-c components of the second-rank permittivity), whereas classes such as m, mm2, −4, 422, −42m, 32, 622, 23, and 432—often cited by phenomenology—are not anticipated as optically active within this framework; notably, the non-enantiomorphous classes m, mm2, and −42m are explicitly stated as not predicted to be optically active here.",
  "The paper explicitly lists the ten polar (non-centrosymmetric) crystal point groups—1, m, 2, 2 mm, 3, 3 m, 4, 4 mm, 6, and 6 mm—and notes that pyroelectricity occurs in these polar classes, with additional allowance in the Curie groups N and Nmm.",
  "Optical activity may occur in the achiral classes m, mm2, 4, and 42m; among these, m, mm2, and 4 are polar (pyroelectric), while 42m is nonpolar, as it is not included in the listed ten pyroelectric classes.",
  "The paper states that optical activity may occur in the four non-enantiomorphous classes m, mm2, 4, and 42m; since the ten polar classes are 6mm, 4mm, 6, 4, 3m, 3, mm2, 2, m, and 1, this implies that among these four, 42m is the achiral, nonpolar class compatible with optical activity.",
  "Short-chain OG can often deactivate membrane proteins, whereas adding lipids (including phosphatidylcholine and other native or synthetic lipids) to OG micelles increases thermal stability of folded proteins; additionally, specific lipids like cardiolipin can be essential for the function of certain membrane proteins, with lipid removal abolishing activity.",
  "In yeast mitochondria, cardiolipin is not required for formation of complexes III–IV supercomplexes but is crucial for their stability; without cardiolipin these assemblies are significantly less stable and other phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol) do not prevent dissociation, whereas adding cardiolipin restores wild-type stability.",
  "Cardiolipin binds at the NhaA dimer interface and is specifically required to assemble and stabilize the oligomeric state: high concentrations of DDM detergent remove interfacial lipids and split dimers into monomers, whereas cardiolipin is uniquely effective at reconstituting and stabilizing the dimer.",
  "Many lipid classes, including glycerophospholipids and acidic glycosphingolipids, preferentially ionize in negative mode; applying an aqueous wash (ammonium formate or acetate) before MALDI IMS markedly boosts negative-ion lipid signals and analyte counts, achieving up to fivefold increases in total ion current and supporting high-resolution lipid imaging.",
  "The review notes that detergents can form detergent–protein complexes that sometimes strip surrounding lipids—whose removal can destabilize membrane proteins—and details that OG is a non-ionic detergent with a high CMC (~0.53%/20 mM) and compact micelles (~25 kDa), whereas CHAPS is a zwitter-ionic, bile-salt-derived detergent with a similarly high CMC (~0.5%/8–10 mM) but very small micelles (~6–7 kDa).",
  "Native ion mobility mass spectrometry shows that specific lipids can markedly stabilize membrane protein complexes and modulate their function (e.g., cardiolipin strongly stabilizes and regulates AqpZ), while commonly used detergents such as DDM/OGNG/NG can promote gas-phase unfolding, underscoring that both lipid binding and detergent environment influence the observed structural state.",
  "Native MS can preserve non-covalent lipid and detergent interactions with membrane protein complexes and enables assessment of how different detergents influence oligomeric state, bound lipids, and stability, with specific phospholipid interactions identifiable directly from mass spectra.",
  "Native MS results show that specific interfacial lipids—especially cardiolipin—can be required to stabilize membrane protein oligomers; delipidating detergents shift proteins to monomers, lipid reintroduction restores oligomers, and changing the lipid composition modulates the monomer–oligomer equilibrium.",
  "Cardiolipin directly modulates oligomerization and assembly of mitochondrial membrane proteins including OPA1 and DRP1 and is required for the structural integrity of respiratory chain supercomplexes demonstrating lipid dependent control of mitochondrial protein complex stability.",
  "UCP1 retains approximately three tightly bound cardiolipin molecules per protein, and cardiolipin specifically and markedly stabilizes UCP1—more than phosphatidylcholine—across reconstitution and thermal denaturation assays, indicating an integral role of cardiolipin in maintaining UCP1 structural integrity.",
  "Anionic lipids such as cardiolipin are preferentially detected by negative-ion ESI-MS as [M−H]− and often as doubly charged [M−2H]2− ions with characteristic 0.5 Da isotopic spacing; however, ESI can also generate artifacts including adducts and dimers that complicate spectral interpretation.",
  "In vitro reconstitution from purified yeast complexes III and IV shows that membrane cardiolipin is essential for robust supercomplex formation: PC/PE alone yields variable or low trimer and no tetramer, while added cardiolipin specifically promotes distinct formation of both III2IV1 and III2IV2, with no other anionic phospholipid matching cardiolipin’s effectiveness.",
  "In single-collision reactions of Cl with partially deuterated methane (e.g., CHD3), IR excitation of the COH stretch enhances reactivity and directs bond cleavage toward H abstraction, while COD stretch excitation favors D abstraction; this bond selectivity persists across isotopologues.",
  "For CH3D reacting with atomic chlorine, exciting the symmetric COH stretch increases reactivity by about sevenfold compared to antisymmetric COH stretch excitation, demonstrating strong mode-dependent reactivity differences.",
  "Experiments show that IR excitation of the C–H stretch in CHD3 reduces reactivity for the H-abstraction channel in F + CHD3 (Son/Soﬀ < 1), with widespread product signal depletions; the exception is CHD2(v1=1), indicating that D-abstraction proceeds while the initially excited C–H bond behaves as a spectator and retains its vibrational energy in the CHD2 product.",
  "The inhibitory effect is attributed to entrance-valley anisotropic interactions from pre-reaction van der Waals wells that can modify transition-state control in low, early-barrier reactions; while one QCT study reproduced the inhibition, later QCT studies on different PESs did not, leaving the theory–experiment discrepancy unresolved.",
  "A cited experimental study on the early-barrier F + CHD3 reaction reports that CH stretching excitation inhibits CH bond cleavage, indicating reduced reactivity of the C–H bond under CH-stretch vibrational excitation.",

  "YOLO is a unified object detector that predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single network pass and runs in real time (45–155 fps), but its grid-based design (two boxes and one class per cell) limits detection of nearby objects and makes it struggle with small objects appearing in groups.",
  "EfficientNet delivers faster inference and smaller models than ResNet-152 (e.g., EfficientNet-B1 is 5.7x faster and 7.6x smaller) while maintaining high accuracy and strong transfer performance, including 98.8% accuracy on a Flowers dataset, indicating suitability for efficient large-scale image classification tasks.",
  "In 100-m² experimental plots of Delphinium barbeyi, observers recorded each visiting pollinator’s species (including bumble bee caste) and counted the number of focal plant flowers visited, then computed visitation rate as the proportion of open flowers visited per minute; in this system Bombus appositus workers accounted for over three-quarters of all visits.",
  "In evaluating pollinators of a buzz-pollinated plant, researchers identified at least 30 bee species and manually quantified behavior by following individual bees and using voice recordings to derive time spent per flower and the number of flowers and plants visited per minute.",
  "Fast R-CNN performs object detection by producing, for each region of interest, both class probabilities and class-specific bounding-box refinements, and demonstrates high efficiency (about 0.3 seconds per image excluding proposal generation) with substantial training and testing speed-ups over R-CNN and SPPnet (up to 213× faster at test time and cutting VGG16 training from 84 hours to 9.5 hours).",

  "Based on adult head and mouthpart morphology, the authors infer that Micromalthus likely feeds on wood infested with fungi and argue adult feeding is not obsolete, though specific adult feeding habits remain largely unknown.",
  "In Micromalthus debilis, adult males arise exclusively via a metrophagous route in which the curculioid first-stage larva (from a single egg laid by an oviparous paedogenetic mother) feeds on the contents of its mother’s body before continuing through a short-legged prepupal stage to pupation and adult emergence; females develop from cerambicoid larvae without metrophagy.",
  "Micromalthus debilis larvae occupy and feed within moist, decayed wood (notably the outer layers in the red stage of decay); newly born legged larvae enter wood pores, begin feeding (as indicated by brown decayed-wood material in the gut), and then lose their legs to become the typical legless larval form.",
  "In Micromalthus debilis, the male develops via a short-legged larval stage that consumes its paedogenetic mother, and the literature states that a male larva’s sole source of food is its mother, indicating obligate male cannibalism.",
  "Micromalthus debilis larvae are wood-borers that develop in and feed mainly on moist, decaying wood, often associated with brown or white rot fungi, and the species is recognized as a minor pest in humid wooden structures.",
  "Micromalthus debilis exhibits offspring consumption of the mother (matriphagy), the oviparous first-instar male larva is legless and currently a developmental dead end, and many induced adults show extreme internal organ reduction with nearly empty abdomens.",

  "An O2F2-based route forms XeF4 at sub-zero temperatures: xenon with excess O2F2 is condensed at -196 °C, warmed to -120 °C, then maintained at -78 °C overnight; repeating this treatment yields pure XeF4 quantitatively.",
  "Under excess O2F2 at low temperatures, xenon is first converted to a XeF2/XeF4 mixture; prolonged exposure fluoridates Xe(II) to Xe(IV) without forming XeF6, enabling high-purity XeF4 production.",
  "Xenon fluorides can be generated and studied at very low temperatures, including matrix isolation conditions (solid Ar/Ne), as demonstrated for XeF6; related xenon fluoride adducts (e.g., XeF2·CrOF4) were synthesized and structurally characterized at low temperatures.",

  "In Ficus carica, female Blastophaga psenes are attracted to receptive fig odours and use a precise blend of four common VOCs to locate their host; the fig scent is species-specific and does not elicit preference between male and female receptive figs.",
  "Receptive figs emit volatile attractants with species-specific profiles that guide pollinator arrival at appropriate hosts, while female fig wasps are capable of dispersing above the forest canopy over distances exceeding 10 km.",
  "The author proposes that receptive figs emit species-specific allomones that attract pollinating wasps, and separately notes that the pseudolocule’s air is nearly sterile due to ostiolar air locks, while also stating that wasps are likely cued to species-specific chemical signals.",
  "Ficus ingens syconia emit volatile compounds detected via gas chromatography during the female receptive phase, with field observations showing concurrent wasp visitation; the paper notes odour-based attraction of the specific pollinator and references long-distance attraction in the genus Ficus, suggesting potential species-specific volatile signatures.",
  "In Ficus semicordata, long-range floral volatiles from receptive figs attract female pollinators and can be species- and developmental-stage specific, while additional contact cues on the fig surface further influence which pollinator ultimately enters the syconium.",

  "A 2022 systematic review finds that managed and introduced bees—especially the globally introduced Apis mellifera—are predominantly associated with negative impacts on wild bees, with about two-thirds of study outcomes reporting harm and most experimental studies showing significant negative fitness effects, alongside frequent indications of pathogen spillover.",
  "Experimental introduction of high-density Apis mellifera populations reduced wild pollinator diversity and interaction links, disrupted network structure (notably by eroding interactions of native generalists), and lowered plant reproductive success for species heavily visited by honeybees, indicating serious negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",
  "Spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) infestations in Northeastern U.S. vineyards are associated with severe agricultural impacts, including reduced fruit production and reports of complete vine loss, and have been linked to substantial economic costs, exemplified by an estimated annual $50.1 million loss in Pennsylvania.",
  "Maruca vitrata is a pantropical pest of legumes with a distribution spanning West Africa to the Pacific and occurring in the Neotropics (including southern Florida), and it can cause severe agricultural losses, with reported annual losses of about US$30 million in the semi-arid tropics and crop damage ranging from 25–85% in cowpea and up to complete loss of flower buds and pods in black gram.",
  "Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Colorado potato beetle) is native to the southwestern United States and Mexico; it has expanded to a current range of about 16 million km² across North America, Europe, and Asia, and is widely regarded as the most important insect defoliator of potatoes, capable of completely destroying crops if left uncontrolled.",
  "Leptinotarsa decemlineata is identified as the most important insect defoliator of potatoes, capable of completely destroying crops, with a vast and expanding range (~16 million km2 across North America, Europe, and Asia) and substantial per-individual foliage consumption by both larvae and adults.",
  "The spotted lanternfly has established in the eastern United States and, due to its highly polyphagous feeding across agricultural and natural forested habitats, has caused economic and ecological disruption; high-density infestations deposit honeydew that fosters sooty mold, which can blacken substrates and may lead to localized death of understory plants in wooded edge habitats.",
  "The guide identifies Apis mellifera as a non-native European honey bee in the U.S. and notes that introductions of European parasites and diseases through commercial bumble bee trade have likely contributed to declines in certain western native bumble bees.",
  "In 2016, CDC indicated that Aedes aegypti is more likely than Aedes albopictus to transmit viruses such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, and provided maps showing the mosquitoes’ potential U.S. range and areas of prior detection, while clarifying that the maps are not risk assessments and do not indicate exact locations or likelihood of virus spread.",
  "In a high-diversity desert bee community near the Arizona–New Mexico border (San Bernardino Valley), Apis mellifera was the only introduced bee species detected, comprising 3.5% of all bee captures, with the pollinator assemblage otherwise largely native.",
  "Lycorma delicatula (spotted lanternfly) is an invasive planthopper newly detected in the U.S. that has caused economic damage to vineyards in Korea and poses a risk to North American vineyards and other crops/ornamentals; its spread potential is heightened by egg-laying on nonplant materials and the widespread invasive host Ailanthus altissima across the United States.",
  "Environmental suitability modeling across the contiguous United States indicates that several counties in the Southwest and California are suitable for Aedes aegypti (but not Aedes albopictus), and Aedes aegypti—known to transmit yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika—persists across much of the southern tier of the country.",
  "A systematic review found that managed bees, including Apis mellifera and Bombus spp., frequently have negative effects on wild bees, with negative competitive effects more common when managed bees are used outside their native ranges and pathogen transmission studies showing predominantly negative outcomes for wild bees.",

  "The review defines ligands to include small organic and inorganic molecules and highlights tools (e.g., LigDig, FunFOLD3, COACH) that can identify ligands and their protein partners, with LigDig leveraging ChEBI and PubChem to locate similar ligands and potential binding partners and FunFOLD3/COACH outputting putative ligands that may bind to specific proteins.",
  "In milkweeds, nectar-foraging insects effect pollination by contacting floral hoods and transferring pollinia to stigmatic chambers; interspecific flights reduce male and female fitness, while unispecific patches show higher fruit initiation and maturation than mixed-species plots.",
  "Asclepias exaltata is self-incompatible and depends on strong-flying insect contact to transport pollinia; each pollinium carries roughly 180 grains—sufficient to fertilize all ovules—so a single successful pollinium transfer can produce a many-seeded fruit, and pollinia can remain on pollinators for hours, facilitating outcrossing and long-distance dispersal.",
  "In Asclepias tuberosa, higher pollinator activity on a single plant (more removals/insertions) does not proportionally increase fruit-set because many insertions are within-plant pollinations and most Asclepias are self-incompatible; thus, behaviors that keep pollinators on one plant can restrict fruit production despite increased visitation.",
  "In Asclepias tuberosa, large bees and wasps effect pollination, but the species is largely self-incompatible; while larger and overlapping floral displays can increase pollinaria removal (a proxy for pollinator activity), within-plant flowering overlap promotes geitonogamy and self-pollination, which is suggested to restrict fruit-set in natural populations.",
  "In Asclepias syriaca, sequential flowering within umbels and an age-dependent nectar peak (~50 hours after anthesis) ensure continuous high-reward blossoms that encourage pollinator visits, a pattern the authors state facilitates better foraging and increased pollination.",
  "In Asclepias incarnata, pollinator behaviors that increase effective pollen transfer (e.g., longer flower-handling time) correlate with higher pollinium deposition and transfer efficiency, and higher pollinium insertion is associated with increased fruit-set (in 1995), directly linking contact-mediated pollination to plant reproductive success.",
  "In a randomized, double-blind study of acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia, intramuscular olanzapine 10 mg produced a significantly greater reduction in PANSS-EC total score at 2 hours compared with placebo (−9.2±4.5 vs −2.8±5.6; p<.001).",
  "The study permitted a second IM injection at the same 10 mg dose between 2 and 4 hours after the first dose for inadequate response; 44.4% of olanzapine-treated patients received a second injection, and concomitant CNS-active drugs—especially oral benzodiazepines—were generally restricted around IM administration (prohibited from 4 hours before to 2 hours after).",
  "Combining olanzapine with benzodiazepines is not recommended by the manufacturer; consensus guidance advises avoiding this combination, with small retrospective data noting decreased oxygen saturations when intramuscular olanzapine was combined with benzodiazepines in alcohol-ingested patients.",
  "For psychosis-driven agitation, intramuscular olanzapine is a preferred option when oral administration is not possible; if agitation persists after an initial antipsychotic dose, adding a benzodiazepine is generally preferred to repeating the same antipsychotic or adding a second antipsychotic, though olanzapine-specific combination with benzodiazepines is discouraged.",
  "Regulatory guidance indicates caution: FDA labeling advises against concomitant IM olanzapine and benzodiazepine use due to potential excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression, while the European Medicines Agency recommends separating IM doses by at least 60 minutes.",
  "In a single-center medication use evaluation of 91 coadministrations (including 41 within 60 minutes), no serious adverse events were observed, with no hypotension, bradycardia, bradypnea, or oxygen desaturation reported following administration.",
  "A retrospective ED study of 111 adults receiving intramuscular olanzapine with parenteral benzodiazepines found a 12.5% rate of cardiopulmonary compromise within 2 hours; only one case required IV fluids and there were no intubations or significant cardiac events.",
  "Despite the manufacturer’s warning against coadministration, the paper recommends that if this combination is used, patients should be appropriately monitored, and it should be avoided in adults aged 65 years or older due to higher observed risk.",
  "Codon preference plots display all three reading frames alongside open reading frames and rare-codon positions, enabling identification of coding frames and aiding gene localization.",
  "Coding regions show a markedly lower incidence of rare codons compared to non-coding regions, allowing discrimination between coding and non-coding sequences based on codon usage patterns.",
  "Phase (reading frame) is defined by successive non-overlapping trinucleotides starting at the first base; frame-specific coding (‘phase-coding’) exists when these trinucleotides are used as codons, and ORF-based evaluation relies on the length of the longest in-frame stretch without stop codons.",
  "Frame can be inferred using codon-usage-based correspondence analysis; among three frame-shifted windows, the one with the lowest CA score indicates the correct frame, and the paper recommends inferring coding status and frame simultaneously.",
  "The standard genetic code maps 64 triplet codons to 20 amino acids plus start and stop signals, and this mapping is nearly universal across life.",
  "The code’s triplet nature and block structure contribute to robustness against point mutations, translational misreading, and translational frame shifts, aligning with the physical increment of three nucleotides during ribosomal translocation.",
  "The paper defines the standardized one-letter amino acid code (A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y, plus B, Z, X) and specifies that protein sequences are written from the N-terminus (left) to the C-terminus (right).",
  "The one-letter system is intended for concise representation and alignment of long protein sequences, with recommendations that its use be restricted primarily to comparisons of long sequences.",
  "The paper emphasizes that neutral theory provides testable predictions for beta diversity, spatial structure, species–area relationships, and population/community dynamics, but also highlights that purely neutral models tend to exhibit slow dynamics relative to empirical observations, and that distinguishing among models requires collection of dynamic data.",
  "Under Hubbell’s neutral theory, species richness and relative abundances approach a long-term equilibrium maintained by slow speciation and ecological drift; strong dispersal and recruitment limitation can maintain diversity regardless of competitive ability, and local α diversity is largely determined by the regional species pool and long-term habitat composition rather than rapid competitive exclusion.",
  "Under Hubbell’s unified neutral theory, local communities linked to a metacommunity by immigration approach a stationary equilibrium in species richness and relative abundances over time; furthermore, the theory predicts that as immigration decreases, the relative species abundance distribution becomes more skewed (with fewer rare species) in the local community.",
  "Under neutral voter-model dynamics with environmental stochasticity, linear (density-independent) modulation of fitness or mortality by the environment consistently shortens coexistence times, while relative (density-dependent) recruitment can either bolster or diminish coexistence depending on environmental correlation time, with rapid switching enhancing coexistence via Chesson’s storage effect and slow switching reducing it.",
  "Under neutral theory, local communities approach a stationary state where the mean number of species equals νN⟨τ⟩, with local extinctions balanced by colonizations; in the mean-field limit, species composition is spatially well mixed and independent of spatial features.",
  "Under a Hubbell-inspired neutral framework, individuals are ecologically equivalent and species dynamics are governed by birth–death processes with competition enforced through a fixed total community size, making demographic stochasticity the dominant driver; despite these simplifications, such models can accurately capture observed species abundance distributions.",
  "Under the unified neutral theory, local community diversity equilibrates via immigration from a metacommunity; immigrants are disproportionately from species that are more abundant in the metacommunity, rare species are more likely to go locally extinct and take longer to re-immigrate, and immigration is the sole mechanism replenishing species locally.",
  "Under the unified neutral theory, individuals in the same trophic level are demographically equivalent and local communities approach a dynamic equilibrium set by immigration from a metacommunity and local extinction; spatially explicit neutral models predict that community similarity declines steadily with geographic distance.",
  "This review identifies GABAC receptors as GABAA receptor isoforms composed entirely of rho subunits and explains that each GABAA subunit contains an intracellular domain between TM3 and TM4—a lengthy loop that mediates protein interactions and post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation.",
  "This study used M3/M4 loop-deleted constructs for a1 and b1 to enhance expression and omitted poorly resolved M3/M4 loops and M4 helices from the final model while the g2S subunit construct included an insertion between Asp374 and Cys375.",
  "The human GABA ρ1 receptor’s intracellular M3–M4 loop is reported as 82 amino acids long in this study, and complete replacement of this loop with a 7-amino-acid prokaryotic sequence yielded functional, anion-selective GABA ρ1 channels.",
  "The paper provides a schematic of the GABA ρ1 subunit showing four transmembrane segments (M1–M4) and marks the characteristic extracellular Cys–Cys motif, but does not enumerate cysteine residues within the intracellular TM3–TM4 linker.",
  "In GABAA receptors, the intracellular domain (TM3–TM4 loop) is a poorly conserved region that lies between the M3 and M4 helices and mediates interactions with intracellular proteins; for homomeric GABAA-ρ receptors, GABA binds at ρ–ρ interfaces in the extracellular domain.",
  "The human GABAA ρ1 TM3–TM4 intracellular loop spans residues 355–454, with a defined MAP1B-binding motif (RI(D/N)THAIDKYSR) located at the C-terminal end within the S434–R454 region.",
  "The paper specifies that each GABAρ1 receptor subunit includes a variable intracellular loop connecting TM3 and TM4 but does not provide residue-specific composition or counts for this linker.",
  "This study provides the full amino acid sequence of the human GABA rho1 (termed GABA P1) subunit and annotates predicted transmembrane segments and the conserved Cys-Cys loop, facilitating identification of the intracellular TM3–TM4 linker region within this receptor.",
  "The paper investigates homomeric human ñ1 (GABAC) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells, focusing on ion selectivity, pore size (~0.61 nm), and single-channel chord conductance (0.65 pS at 20 mM [Cl−]i; 1.59 pS at 100 mM [Cl−]i), without providing residue-level counts for intracellular linker regions.",
  "The review notes that human GABAA receptors include three ρ subunits (formerly GABAC), each subunit has four transmembrane segments with a large intracellular M3–M4 loop, and all eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors share a conserved extracellular motif of two cysteines separated by 13 residues.",
  "At pH 5.2–6.2 sulfanilamide is essentially fully neutral (≥99.99%), and its interactions with soil organic matter involve hydrogen bonding at polar sites and dispersion/π–π interactions at nonpolar aromatic moieties, with stronger binding to charged and highly polar components than to hydrophobic ones.",
  "The study precisely measured sulfanilamide pKa values in water (27±1°C, ionic strength 0.2) and found that N1‑arylsulfanilamide acidity follows a Hammett correlation; additionally, for sulfanilamides with pKa ≤ 5.4, the sulfonamide NH dissociation overlaps with dissociation involving the para‑amino group.",
  "A summarized patent disclosure describes sulfonamide derivatives as ligands of the 5‑HT6 receptor for potential CNS therapeutic use and outlines a radioligand binding assay employing CHO cell membranes expressing human 5‑HT6 receptors with [3H]LSD to quantify binding.",
  "This study describes a green aqueous method where TCCA oxidatively chlorinates thiols/disulfides to sulfonyl chlorides that react in situ with amines (using K2CO3 instead of excess amine) to give sulfonamides; it includes the o-toluidine-derived product N-o-tolylbenzenesulfonamide with a reported melting point of 109–111 °C.",
  "The paper establishes that sulfonamides (SO2NHR) are acidic and that substitution patterns modulate their acidity: primary benzene sulfonamides, 4-amino-N-phenylbenzenesulfonamides (secondary), and phenylsulfonylureas each show strong linear relationships between specific bond lengths and aqueous pKa; notably, electron-withdrawing aryl groups at nitrogen increase the acidity of the –SO2NH– proton, often leading to ionization near physiological pH.",
  "The study reports a metal-free, NH4I-mediated coupling of sodium sulfinates with amines (including anilines) in CH3CN at 80°C for 12 h to form sulfonamides in moderate to excellent yields, followed by standard workup (NaCl wash, ethyl acetate extraction, drying over Na2SO4) and silica gel chromatography.",
  "In aqueous alkaline hydrolysis of secondary amides (N-methylacetamide, N-methylbenzamide, acetanilide), the mechanism proceeds via two free-energy barriers—formation of a tetrahedral intermediate and its subsequent breakdown—with the second transition state (cleavage of the tetrahedral adduct) being rate-determining; in water, OH− operates as a hydrogen-bonded [OH···H2O]− complex, and for N-methylacetamide and N-methylbenzamide an ancillary water molecule catalyzes proton transfer steps.",
  "An electrochemical microflow method forms sulfonamides directly from thiols and amines under mild acidic conditions (CH3CN/0.3 M HCl), using a slight excess of amine, no catalysts or sacrificial reagents, completing in 5 minutes with hydrogen gas evolved at the counter electrode.",
  "Calcium triflimide (Ca(NTf2)2) enables efficient conversion of sulfonyl fluorides to sulfonamides with amines (often using 2 equivalents of amine, or 1 equivalent plus an added base), and reactions proceed poorly without the Lewis acid under the reported conditions.",
  "In preparing 18O-labeled amides, the authors distilled labeled acetyl chloride into ~2.2 equivalents of amine per 1 equivalent of acyl chloride and obtained essentially quantitative amide yields calculated based on 1 equivalent of amine, reflecting consumption of an additional amine equivalent by the HCl byproduct during acylation.",
  "In a meta-analysis of five RCTs (n=3,000) in locally advanced or metastatic TNBC, adding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone significantly prolonged overall survival in the intention-to-treat population (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81–0.97) and the PD-L1-positive population (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71–0.91), with no OS benefit observed in PD-L1-negative patients (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82–1.19).",
  "In this meta-analysis of 11 RCTs in unresectable or metastatic TNBC, PD-1 inhibitors versus chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall survival in both the intention-to-treat and PD-L1–positive (CPS ≥ 1) populations, with increasing OS benefit at higher PD-L1 CPS thresholds (≥10 and ≥20).",
  "This paper defines six molecular subtypes of TNBC—including an immunomodulatory subtype enriched for immune cell signaling, cytokine signaling, and antigen processing/presentation pathways—while highlighting the poor prognosis and limited effectiveness of standard chemotherapy in metastatic TNBC.",
  "Across six randomized trials in mTNBC, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors did not improve overall survival in the intention-to-treat population, but significantly prolonged overall survival in the PD-L1–positive subgroup compared with chemotherapy (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.93).",
  "This meta-analysis computed OS effects using intention-to-treat populations and found that pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) in neoadjuvant settings showed a prolonged but statistically insignificant overall survival versus chemotherapy, while cited external evidence indicated that PD-L1–positive patients may derive greater benefit (with a trend to improved OS) compared with PD-L1–negative patients.",
  "In KEYNOTE-355, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 tumors in the global analysis, and in the Asian subgroup analysis OS favored pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy across PD-L1 CPS ≥10, CPS ≥1, and ITT populations (HRs 0.54, 0.62, and 0.57, respectively), with ITT median OS 24.1 vs 17.2 months.",
  "The review notes that pembrolizumab (PD-1) and atezolizumab (PD-L1) received FDA approval for TNBC specifically in patients whose tumors overexpress PD-L1, indicating checkpoint inhibitor use is tied to PD-L1-positive disease.",
  "In the randomized phase III IMpassion130 trial of nab-paclitaxel plus atezolizumab versus chemotherapy alone in first-line metastatic TNBC, a clinically meaningful overall survival improvement was observed in the PD-L1-positive subgroup, whereas no OS benefit was seen in PD-L1-negative tumors; the intention-to-treat population showed a smaller OS difference.",
  "In patients with pulmonary valve regurgitation causing right ventricular volume overload, right-to-left shunting across a patent foramen ovale can produce exertional hypoxemia and cyanosis; addressing the pulmonary valve lesion first allows safe subsequent PFO closure and resolves hypoxia.",
  "In tricuspid valve stenosis, the diastolic rumble intensifies during inspiration (Rivero-Carvallo sign) because the inspiratory fall in right atrial pressure is less than that in the right ventricle, increasing the tricuspid valve gradient and thus murmur loudness.",
  "In pulmonary hypertension, patients typically present with progressive exertional dyspnea; on exam, a loud second heart sound and a systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation may be heard, while the ECG commonly shows right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.",
  "In neonates, a pansystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border on the first day of life is more likely due to tricuspid regurgitation; pulmonary hypertension can render this murmur indistinguishable from that of a small VSD, and the initial low left-to-right ventricular pressure gradient explains why VSD murmurs may be detected later.",
  "In patent ductus arteriosus, a continuous (Gibson) murmur is typical, but when pulmonary artery pressure becomes sufficiently high to balance or reverse the ductal shunt the continuous murmur can be abolished; cases with significant pulmonary hypertension are often atypical from the outset, lacking the Gibson murmur and showing early dyspnea, cyanosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy on clinical and ECG evaluation.",
  "In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, inspiration increases venous return, augments left-sided filling, and lessens LV outflow obstruction, producing a relative rise in blood pressure during inspiration (reversed pulsus paradoxus).",
  "Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with asymmetric septal hypertrophy presents with a late-peaking systolic murmur at the left sternal border that increases with standing and Valsalva and decreases with squatting; Valsalva elevates the LVOT gradient (e.g., from 55 to 114 mmHg) due to septal hypertrophy causing high-velocity flow and anterior motion of the mitral valve.",
  "Mitral valve prolapse typically produces a late systolic, medium- to high-pitched murmur best heard at the apex, often preceded by a mid-systolic click; the timing of clicks and murmurs can shift with maneuvers such as inspiration and standing.",
  "For open-chain dienes such as butadiene, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene (1122) forms cyclobutane adducts; the butadiene-1122 adduct (adduct 4) was structurally confirmed by oxidation to an unsaturated acid (acid 3).",
  "Under sealed-tube conditions at 80 °C with 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene in excess and an inhibitor, butadiene forms a single 1,2-cycloaddition product identified as 1,1-difluoro-2,2-dichloro-3-vinylcyclobutane, supported by v.p.c. homogeneity, IR evidence of a vinyl group (1646 cm−1), and degradation studies.",
  "The review documents that electron-deficient haloalkenes, including tetrachloroethylene, undergo [2 + 2] photocycloadditions (e.g., with isocoumarins) under direct excitation, and that highly electron-deficient fluorinated vinyl groups can also participate in intramolecular [2 + 2] additions; additionally, acetone (ET ≈ 332 kJ mol−1) is highlighted as a common triplet sensitizer enabling such photocycloadditions.",
  "Thermal 2π−2π cycloadditions form four-membered rings and, for reactions of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene with dienes, the difluoromethylene unit bonds to the terminal carbons of the diene, establishing a preferred regiochemistry.",
  "A reinvestigation found that butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene produce a minor 1,4-cycloaddition product identified as 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-Δ4-cyclohexene, whose fraction increases from 0.9% at 60°C to 2.3% at 176°C and whose identity was corroborated by dehydrohalogenation to o-chlorofluorobenzene.",
  "Under CS-symmetric pyridine(diimine) iron catalysis, butadiene and ethylene form mixtures of vinylcyclobutane (via [2+2] cycloaddition) and (Z)-hexa-1,4-diene (via hydrovinylation), with observed ratios near 1:1 depending on the specific catalyst and conditions.",
  "In reactions of butadiene with halogenated ethylenes, experimental and theoretical results show a strong tendency toward (2 + 2) cycloaddition under kinetic control; specifically for tetrafluoroethylene, the 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-vinylcyclobutane is formed at lower temperatures, whereas the Diels–Alder cyclohexene product becomes favored thermodynamically at higher temperatures.",

  "In rhesus monkey prestriate cortex, V1 projects directly to V2 and V3 (fine fibers to V2, coarse to V3), V3A does not receive direct V1 input but does receive input from V3; V2 projects directly to both V3 and V4, while a direct V2→V3A projection was not demonstrated for central visual fields (with some experiments on V2→V3A deemed inconclusive).",
  "In the macaque ventral pathway, V2 sends forward projections to V3 and V4; V4 is connected with both TEO and TE; and TEO predominantly sends feed-forward projections to TE (while providing feedback to earlier areas), establishing a feasible ventral stream route V1→V2→V3/V4→TEO→TE.",
  "In macaque, area V4 has reciprocal connections with V2 and V3 and forward projections to V3A, V4t, MT, TEO, and inferotemporal subdivisions (TEp, TEm); its peripheral-field representation additionally projects to parietal areas (DP, 7, PO, VIP) and area TF, and it maintains bidirectional subcortical links with the amygdala (lateral basal nuclei), pulvinar, and claustrum, illustrating both bidirectional and cross-stream connectivity.",
  "In macaque ventral (‘what’) processing, inferior temporal areas TE/TEO receive inputs from prestriate cortex (notably V4, with lesser contributions from V2/V3) and from parahippocampal TF/TH, while dorsal prestriate areas such as V3A do not project to inferior temporal cortex; a preliminary region termed ‘VTF’ has been noted at the posterior end of TF on the parahippocampal gyrus.",
  "V4 sits centrally in the ventral object-recognition pathway, receiving and projecting back to V2 and V3 (bidirectional), projecting forward to inferior temporal cortex (TEO, TEp, TEm) and MT/FST, showing intermediate-type links with V3A/V4t/TEa/FEF, additionally projecting to TF from peripheral-field representations, with central V4 more connected to ventral-stream areas and peripheral V4 more to dorsal-stream areas.",
  "In macaque ventral visual cortex, fMRI retinotopic maps show ordered adjacency from V3v to V4v to TEO, with V4v bordering TEO anteriorly and TEO’s constant-eccentricity maps extending those of V1–V4; overall, ventral cortex exhibits a predominance of foveal signals relative to dorsal cortex.",
  "CBASS immunity links CD-NTase-synthesized cyclic oligonucleotide second messengers (including noncanonical 2′–5′ linkages) to SA VED-domain effectors such as Cap4/Cap5, whose activation is strictly ligand-specific and confers measurable antiphage protection by markedly reducing phage plaque formation.",
  "Pycsar operons encode pyrimidine cyclases that generate cCMP or cUMP specifically upon phage infection (undetectable in uninfected cells but accumulating post-infection in cyclase-expressing cells), and these cyclic pyrimidines activate effectors to mediate an antiviral, abortive infection response that confers substantial defense in plaque assays.",
  "Low concentrations of specific antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline) and glycerol can increase phage plaque size and contrast in DLA assays, improving visibility and the accuracy of pfu enumeration without suppressing phage development; when plaques are very small, traditional DLA can undercount phage, whereas improved visibility can yield higher apparent titers due to reduced counting error.",
  "An endogenous bacterial CBASS defense reduces phage replication, while a phage-encoded anti-defense protein (Acb2) is required for phage success in the presence of CBASS by binding and sequestering the CBASS signaling molecule 3’,3’-cGAMP, thereby preventing effector activation.",

  "Thoeris is a bacterial anti-phage defense system in which a TIR-domain protein (ThsB) and an NAD-binding protein (ThsA) are both required; TIR domains have NAD+ hydrolase activity that generates linear and cyclic ADP-ribose molecules in other contexts, and experimental mutations show that NAD+ binding/hydrolysis is essential for Thoeris-mediated protection against phages.",
  "The T7 Ocr DNA mimic protein enables phage escape from the BREX defense by binding the BrxX methyltransferase and suppressing both methylation and exclusion activities; wild-type T7 (with Ocr) lyses BREX+ cells, whereas T7 lacking Ocr is inhibited.",
  "Bacteriophage T7 encodes the ocr (gene 0.3) antirestriction protein—a DNA mimic that is expressed early and broadly inhibits type I restriction/modification systems by binding them tightly and displacing DNA, with EcoKI exhibiting stronger affinity for ocr than for DNA.",
  "Certain bacterial antiphage systems (e.g., Thoeris) generate small-molecule second messengers upon phage infection to trigger abortive infection (such as NAD depletion), and phages can evolve anti-defense strategies to counter these host defenses.",
  "Bacterial antiviral systems such as CBASS and Thoeris generate small-molecule second messengers upon phage infection to trigger abortive infection, and phages counter these defenses by encoding proteins that enzymatically degrade or otherwise neutralize these signaling molecules.",
  "GTPS is a clinical diagnosis characterized by lateral hip/thigh pain worsened by activity and side-lying; iliotibial band and tensor fascia lata can contribute to pathology, and Trendelenburg’s sign is highlighted as a sensitive and specific objective finding for gluteus medius/minimus tears.",
  "In healthy adults performing sidelying hip abduction, adding a towel-based pelvic stabilizer did not increase gluteus medius EMG but significantly reduced tensor fascia latae and quadratus lumborum activation during early repetitions, indicating reduced compensatory activity while maintaining gluteus medius engagement.",
  "Greater trochanteric pain syndrome is characterized by lateral hip pain that worsens with side lying and is provoked by resisted hip abduction and external rotation, with physical exam often revealing pain and weakness during hip abduction and extension testing.",
  "In evaluating greater trochanteric pain syndrome, resisted hip abduction is performed with the patient in lateral decubitus (affected side up) and the hip and knee extended; pain during abduction against resistance demonstrates high specificity (93%) for GTPS.",
  "In participants with gluteus medius weakness performing side-lying hip abduction, positioning in anterior log-rolling (versus neutral or posterior) increases gluteus medius and gluteus maximus activation and decreases tensor fasciae latae activation, while prior evidence indicates that internal hip rotation during this exercise reduces tensor fasciae latae activation relative to the gluteals.",
  "The inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus, which performs hip extension and external rotation; injury leads to weak or absent hip extension and a characteristic backward trunk lurch during gait.",
  "The obturator nerve innervates the medial thigh adductor muscles and supplies sensory input to the medial upper thigh; in obturator nerve entrapment, pain is characteristically worsened by hip abduction and extension, while resisted adduction typically does not provoke pain.",
  "The obturator nerve innervates the thigh adductor muscles, and its stimulation can provoke adductor spasms; targeted obturator nerve blockade with local anesthetic prevents these adductor muscle spasms during TURBT.",
  "The study shows that solvent choice (toluene vs THF) controls the product profile in reactions of [MeNacNacTi(Cl){η2-P(SiMe3)-PtBu2}] with lithium nucleophiles, with distinct complexes forming in each solvent and direct experimental evidence that solvent polarity has a decisive impact on the resulting products.",
  "Fluoride-coordinated 11B NMR enables in situ identification and quantification of coexisting boron species: boronic acids (~3 ppm as trifluoroborates), boronate esters (~9 ppm as fluoroboronate esters), and amine-coordinated boronate esters (~14 ppm), with the fluoride addition not significantly altering the boronic acid/boronate ester equilibrium.",
  "THF, as a Lewis-basic solvent, increases alkyllithium reactivity but reduces stability and alters aggregation; mixtures of a non-polar solvent with THF can improve yield/selectivity in some reactions, and use of more polar NMR solvents can trigger side reactions or change aggregation, complicating NMR analysis.",
  "In THF, the efficiency of halogen–lithium exchange to generate aryllithiums is highly sensitive to temperature and reaction time; at very low temperatures (below −48 °C) the exchange can be incomplete, while increasing temperature and/or residence time improves yields.",
  "The study demonstrates that n-BuLi forms solvated complexes with ether ligands (THF and DEE) at low temperature; 6Li NMR and 1H DOSY at −40 °C distinguish unsolvated versus ether-solvated n-BuLi, and a binding-equilibrium framework shows that observed diffusion coefficients reflect a weighted average of bound and unbound ligand states.",
  "Commercial methyllithium solutions commonly contain LiCl that forms mixed MeLi/LiCl aggregates; at ambient temperature these give a single averaged 7Li NMR signal whose chemical shift enables quantification of LiCl content, while at lower temperatures (ca. −50 to −80 °C) the signal splits into distinct peaks corresponding to MeLi, LiCl, and an equimolar mixed oligomer.",
  "In 1,2-dihaloarenes containing iodine, n-BuLi effects selective iodine–lithium exchange in toluene; performing the exchange at higher temperatures (−15 to 25 °C) improved outcomes compared to −78 °C, while preserving selectivity for iodine over other halogens.",
  "11B-NMR spectra of boronic acids can display multiple peaks corresponding to distinct boron species (e.g., solvent/hydroxide adducts, partially bound diol complexes, and species with two diols bound), with peaks that may appear or disappear as conditions (such as pH and binding state) change.",
  "The paper explains that LD can make non-causal SNPs appear associated with a complex trait and that incomplete LD between genotyped SNPs and causal variants contributes to missing heritability, with GWAS signals spread widely across the genome, consistent with many small-effect loci.",
  "GWAS signals rely on LD and therefore often tag rather than identify causal variants; distinguishing a causal variant from correlated neighbors within an LD block is statistically limited (scaling with n[1 − r^2]), and in practice many associated loci implicate non-nearest genes, highlighting a risk of misinterpretation when inferring causality from LD-structured associations.",
  "The paper explains that SNPs in close physical proximity (within ~10 kb) often exhibit strong LD, enabling indirect detection of unassayed risk variants through correlated assayed SNPs, while also warning that population stratification can produce artifactual LD between otherwise unrelated sites, potentially misleading association results.",
  "Recombination rate heterogeneity—including narrow hotspots with elevated recombination—is a major driver of genome-wide LD patterns; consequently, LD at SNPs can be leveraged to infer local recombination rate variation, with hotspots locally reducing LD relative to surrounding sequence.",
  "In humans, recombination events cluster in LD-defined hotspots that are 1–2 kb wide and spaced on average every 50–100 kb; hotspot activity is influenced by a degenerate 13-mer sequence motif (with SNPs in the motif affecting activity in cis) and by trans-acting PRDM9 zinc finger variants, which account for a notable proportion (~18%) of inter-individual variability in genome-wide hotspot usage.",
  "Human recombination concentrates in hotspots, producing a block-like LD structure where many SNPs within a block are highly correlated and show limited haplotype diversity; consequently, multiple SNPs in the same LD block (or tag SNPs for that block) can serve as proxies for one another and may all display association signals in GWAS even if only one variant is causal.",
  "In northern European populations, LD commonly forms large blocks (half-length ~60 kb with significant LD often up to ~80 kb), and because LD decays unevenly with substantial variability among neighboring SNPs owing to haplotype structure, mapping may require clusters of closely spaced markers; moreover, these large LD blocks can constrain association-mapping resolution to approximately 100 kb.",
  "The paper emphasizes that human genetic variation is structured into LD blocks where a few tag SNPs capture most haplotype diversity; LD patterns vary substantially across the genome with interspersed long- and short-range LD, and tightly linked markers within blocks are statistically dependent—features that shape how association signals can cluster within blocks and must be accounted for in GWAS design and analysis.",
  "Phase II HapMap shows that LD typically occurs in short haplotype blocks separated by recombination hotspots (across which little association remains), but recent identity-by-descent can create long-range haplotype similarity spanning multiple hotspots; furthermore, many common variants near hotspot centers are ‘untaggable,’ prompting the need for additional sequencing in hotspot regions for association studies.",
  "GWAS detects associations via LD between genotyped markers and unobserved causal loci, so non-causal SNPs can appear more strongly associated than causal variants, and the polygenic architecture of complex traits is widely distributed across the genome, complicating interpretation of signals within any single LD block.",
  "In GWAS, LD causes nearby SNPs to be correlated, so multiple significant SNPs within the same genomic region can reflect a single underlying signal; significant findings may be indirect tags rather than causal variants, and association tests are not independent because of LD.",
  "Itaconate forms a stable cysteine thioether (itaconation) via Michael addition yielding a 2,3-dicarboxypropyl adduct; chemoproteomic workflows using an alkyne-modified probe (ITalk) in RAW264.7 macrophages enable click-based enrichment and LC-MS/MS identification of numerous itaconated proteins and specific cysteine sites.",

  "For DADPS-based peptide-centric chemoproteomics with formic acid cleavage, database searches should include a cysteine variable modification of +238.1430 Da (the expected DADPS-derived residue), and users may also observe an additional +266.14 Da cysteine mass shift corresponding to a formate product formed under acid conditions.",

  "Combined oral contraceptives with >20 mg ethinyl estradiol are associated with a 3–6-fold increased VTE risk (absolute risk ~1–3 per 10,000 women-years), with highest risk in the first 6–12 months after initiation; products containing levonorgestrel with 30 mg estrogen are associated with reduced VTE risk and are considered the safest COC choice, especially for first-time users.",
  "Across 19 observational studies in a 2018 meta-analysis, oral progestin-only contraceptives were not associated with increased risks of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hypertension (pooled RRs ~1), whereas injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate increased venous thromboembolism risk (RR 2.62), levonorgestrel intrauterine devices were associated with reduced venous thromboembolism risk (RR 0.53), no blood pressure effect was found, and there was an indication—but not statistically significant—of increased diabetes risk with injectable POCs.",
  "Olfactory migrainous hallucinations are rare (~0.1% of migraine patients) but, in a small prospective series, they recurred about once every three attacks, lasted around 10 minutes, typically resolved before the headache pain began, and exhibited features consistent with ICHD-III beta aura criteria, suggesting they may represent a form of migraine aura despite not being formally classified as such.",
  "In a cohort of 101 migraine patients, 78.2% reported odor-associated attacks; common triggers included perfumes (55.4%), tobacco (47.5%), and fragranced products such as fabric softeners and hairdressing items, with many patients attempting mitigation via masks (42%), air cleaners (22.8%), deodorant sprays (21.8%), or leaving the area (16.8%).",

  "Combined oral contraceptive use is associated with a three- to seven-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis; although all users in this study developed acquired APC resistance, most did not show increased thrombin formation, and the authors recommend careful thrombotic risk assessment prior to prescription while noting that thrombin formation could rise in the presence of additional risk factors.",
  "In Saudi women, use of combined oral contraceptives was associated with a prothrombotic profile characterized by increased thrombin generation and reduced sensitivity to anticoagulant pathways (APC and TM), with these effects being more pronounced among overweight and obese users.",

  "For SpCas9, target sites require an NGG PAM, and specificity generally involves most or all of the 20-nt protospacer plus the PAM; higher Cas9:sgRNA concentration and more active sgRNA architectures decrease specificity and increase off-target cleavage, including at sites with multiple mismatches.",
  "Truncated gRNAs of 17–18 nt complementarity maintain high on-target activity and markedly reduce off-target mutagenesis; the authors recommend selecting unique tru-gRNA target sites with the fewest possible 1–2 mismatch genomic matches and note that shorter guides do not limit targeting range.",
  "For S. pyogenes Cas9, a 5'-NGG-3' PAM is essential for both binding and cleavage, and off-target evaluation can focus on PAM-adjacent sequences since non-PAM sites are generally not interrogated.",
  "SpCas9 uses a 17–20 nt guide sequence adjacent to an NGG PAM, but off-target cleavage can still occur at sites with up to six protospacer mismatches and even non-canonical PAMs (e.g., NAG, NGA, NAA, NGT, NGC, NCG); mismatches near the 3′ end/PAM-proximal region generally reduce cleavage less than those near the 5′ end, highlighting complex positional effects on specificity.",
  "SpCas9 requires an NGG PAM and can induce high-frequency off-target mutations at genomic sites with up to five mismatches to the guide, with evidence suggesting that higher GC-content in the guide:target duplex may increase mismatch tolerance and thus complicate specificity predictions.",
  "SpCas9 (S. pyogenes) targets 20-nt sequences immediately upstream of a 5′-NGG PAM, can also cleave NAG PAMs at approximately one-fifth the efficiency, and off-target risks can be reduced by avoiding potential genomic matches with fewer than three mismatches, ensuring at least two mismatches in PAM-proximal positions for any potential off-targets, favoring clustered or closely spaced mismatches, and by titrating SpCas9/sgRNA levels to increase on-to-off-target specificity.",

  "In prerenal AKI common after surgical blood loss, a BUN/creatinine ratio >20 is typical, and initial management prioritizes restoring intravascular volume to euvolemia; if needed after adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressors can be used to augment renal perfusion pressure.",
  "In traumatic haemorrhage, damage control resuscitation prioritizes early haemorrhage control (e.g., direct pressure, arterial tourniquets, pelvic binders, traction of long-bone fractures), minimizes crystalloid use to avoid dilutional coagulopathy, and focuses initial fluid therapy on blood products—specifically packed red cells and plasma given in a 1:1 ratio during severe haemorrhagic shock.",
  "In adults, balanced crystalloids such as Lactated Ringer’s have been associated with lower rates of mortality, new kidney replacement therapy, and persistent kidney dysfunction than normal saline; large-volume normal saline can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with potential renal vasoconstriction, while Lactated Ringer’s was not independently linked to hyperkalemia even in patients with reduced kidney function.",
  "Brief aqueous washes (e.g., 15 s with 50 mM ammonium formate pH 6.4 or ammonium acetate pH 6.7) before MALDI IMS markedly enhance negative-ion lipid detection (~5× total ion current, >2× peaks), reduce sodium/potassium adduction in positive mode (up to 7× M+H for glycerophosphocholines), and enable ~10 μm spatial resolution imaging without delocalization.",
  "Normal saline contains chloride at 154 mEq/L (40–50% above plasma), and large trials (including SALT-ED in ED patients) found balanced crystalloids reduced major adverse kidney events versus saline; the paper recommends balanced solutions over normal saline for patients at risk or with incipient AKI to minimize AKI and avoid hyperchloremic acidosis.",
  "For hypotensive bleeding trauma patients, initiate crystalloid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride or a balanced crystalloid, use a restricted volume strategy targeting SBP 80–90 mmHg until bleeding is controlled, and avoid Ringer’s lactate in severe head trauma.",
  "In AKI, a BUN/creatinine ratio >20 should not be used to diagnose pre-renal azotemia versus acute tubular necrosis; instead, higher BCRs are associated with greater hospital mortality, and BUN is influenced by multiple non-renal factors, making BCR more prognostic than diagnostic.",
  "Polygenic scores are linear sums of GWAS-weighted SNP effects; in unrelated samples their predictive estimates can reflect not only direct genetic effects but also population stratification, assortative mating, and passive genotype–environment correlation, as evidenced by substantially smaller within-family estimates (about 60% lower for cognitive traits) that indicate inflation of between-family associations, much of which is linked to family SES.",
  "Typical polygenic scores constructed from GWAS summary statistics can be biased by residual population stratification—particularly when incorporating many sub-significant SNPs—leading to artificial signals and reduced applicability across and even within populations.",
  "The paper defines polygenic scores as linear predictors of the additive genetic component of traits and warns that uncorrected population stratification can accumulate across many loci to bias PGS—especially across heterogeneous ancestries—thereby limiting phenotypic prediction and inflating between-population variance in PGS.",
  "Residual population stratification can bias GWAS effect-size estimates so that polygenic scores, even after standard PCA/LMM corrections and when built from significant SNPs, may recapitulate environmental structure; consequently, part of their predictive performance can reflect environmental rather than genetic effects.",
  "Polygenic scores computed from GWAS summary statistics have an expected upper limit of predictive performance equal to the SNP-heritability (hsnp2) of the trait; in practice they underperform hsnp2 due to estimation error and base–target differences but will tend toward hsnp2 as GWAS sample sizes grow, with standard methods summing SNP effects under an additivity assumption and open questions remaining about the additivity of joint effects, especially when incorporating rare and common variants together.",
  "Under assortative mating, marker-based heritability estimators behave differently: HE/LDSC are upwardly biased with respect to both equilibrium and panmictic narrow-sense heritability and remain stable across sample sizes, while REML converges in very large samples to the panmictic narrow-sense heritability (h2_0); inclusion of principal components does not mitigate these AM-induced biases, and the paper does not assess impacts on polygenic scores.",
  "Under HWE, genotype frequencies are modeled from allele frequencies via independent Binomial draws per individual, and the assumption of no population structure (i.i.d. samples) is central; in GWAS practice, HWE serves as a quality-control filter to flag SNPs likely affected by errors, since population structure can otherwise cause apparent deviations from HWE.",
  "The paper explains that standard GWAS/polygenic approaches sum single-variant effects under an additive, independence assumption, yet epistasis is likely and can both generate apparent additive variance and contribute to missing heritability; therefore, non-additive interactions may not be captured by linear, additive models.",
  "GWAS of unrelated individuals can reflect demographic and indirect parental effects in addition to direct genetic effects, whereas within-sibship GWAS provide less-biased estimates of direct effects; these distinctions matter for genomic prediction and downstream analyses.",
  "In a large yeast cross (n=4,390) across 20 traits, additive effects explained a median ~43% of phenotypic variance while pairwise interactions explained ~9%; interactions were generally less than one-quarter of additive effects, rarely occurred without additive components, and the authors infer that uncaptured heritability in genome-wide additive models is likely due primarily to additive effects of variants not tagged by current genotyping.",
  "The paper concludes that mammals exhibit robust germline and early embryonic epigenetic reprogramming, leaving little opportunity for true transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks; as a result, mammalian epialleles are extremely rare and multigenerational epigenetic effects in humans are considered unlikely.",
  "The paper establishes that PCA with Tracy–Widom significance testing provides a formal, fast method to detect population structure; normalization equalizes per-marker variance under HWE, uncorrected structure can cause false positives in case-control studies, and there is a ‘phase change’ threshold whereby, for a fixed dataset size, structure becomes detectable only when population divergence (e.g., FST) exceeds a specific limit.",
  "Across empirical analyses (including human twins) and theoretical models of allele frequency distributions, the paper concludes that additive genetic variance typically constitutes over half—and often nearly all—of total genetic variance for complex traits, with dominance and epistasis contributing relatively little to population-level variance even when non-additive gene action exists at individual loci.",
  "The variance in a quantitative trait explained by a polygenic score is bounded above by the trait’s heritability; with whole-genome genotyping this corresponds to narrow-sense heritability, and achieving prediction close to this bound generally requires very large training samples, while current sample sizes favor association testing over accurate prediction.",
  "The paper argues that simple additive GWAS models underestimate epistasis and fail to capture epigenetic inheritance; consequently, even with improved SNP-based analyses, large portions of the heritable variation in complex traits (such as human height) remain unexplained by conventional sequence-based polygenic predictors.",
  "Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium does not require random mating; non-random (pseudo-random) mating structures can maintain HWE, and common tests labeled as assessing “random mating” typically assess random union of gametes, which can yield HWE across diverse mating patterns.",
  "In humans, true germline-based transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is biologically constrained by the Weismann barrier and extensive epigenetic reprogramming; observed parent–offspring effects such as those from in utero exposure represent fetal programming/intergenerational inheritance rather than proven transmission of epigenetic marks, and current evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance remains inconclusive.",
  "Volatile profiles differ markedly between plant groups (angiosperms emit relatively more GLVs; conifers emit mainly monoterpenoids), emissions are strongly temperature-dependent (rising with temperature up to a threshold), and greater semiochemical diversity in mixed forests can disrupt bark beetle host-finding and reduce outbreak likelihood.",
  "Long-term field data show that opposing, herbivore-specific pressures on Datura wrightii trichome morphs (e.g., Tupiochoris notatus damaging sticky morphs when common and Lema daturaphila increasing damage when velvety morphs are common) contribute to negative frequency-dependent selection that maintains within-population defense polymorphism, with equilibrium frequencies varying among populations due to local environmental conditions and herbivore densities.",
  "Across global sites, insect herbivores become more specialized toward the equator, evidenced by increasing Pareto α and decreasing phylogenetic diet breadth (PD), and the authors note that a greater presence of specialists at lower latitudes could promote diversification of plant traits.",
  "Across 305 plant species, floral VOC profiles were significantly associated with climate: sesquiterpene richness, proportion, and emission rates increased with mean annual temperature, whereas monoterpene relative abundance decreased with mean annual temperature and precipitation, indicating a tendency for monoterpenes to be more prevalent under drier (and cooler) conditions.",
  "Across Lithophragma, both at the clade and population levels, interaction with pollinating Greya moths is associated with a higher number of floral volatile compounds, while at northern range limits generalized pollinators can dominate, indicating geographically variable biotic interactions that correspond with differences in VOC diversity.",
  "Herbivore-induced plant volatiles function both within plants (intraplant signaling) and externally (attracting predators/parasitoids, influencing neighboring plants), and these signals can be eavesdropped by herbivores and pathogens, highlighting a multi-party ecological information dynamic around VOCs.",
  "Across 15 sagebrush populations, higher herbivory (measured as proportion of leaves damaged) was strongly and negatively associated with within-population diversity of volatile chemotypes (Shannon–Wiener index and richness), consistent with the study’s predictions that low herbivory favors diversified, private chemotypes (KSH) while high herbivory favors convergence on fewer, shared cues (MBH).",
  "The review establishes that plant VOCs are highly diverse chemical blends that play central defensive roles—deterring herbivores and florivores and protecting against pathogens—while mediating intra- and interspecific interactions, indicating strong biotic selection pressures on VOC composition and emission profiles.",
  "HI-VOC blends typically include common GLVs but are compositionally specific enough for multiple receivers (herbivores, parasitoids, predators, and neighboring plants) to infer attacker identity; these volatiles aid host/prey location and can benefit plants via carnivore attraction, yet they are also publicly available information that can be exploited by herbivores and hyperparasitoids.",
  "Thymus essential oil (VOC) composition shows high chemodiversity shaped by geography and multiple abiotic factors (e.g., moisture, salinity, temperature, light, heavy metals, soils), with additional intraspecific variation (including distinct chemotypes) further contributing to within-species and within-site variability.",
  "At a global scale, leaf insect herbivory declines from the equator toward the poles; plant functional traits explain more latitudinal variation than climate (7.3% vs. 4.66%), with plant height and mean annual temperature identified as the most important individual drivers, while soil nutrients contribute minimally (0.98%).",
  "The study shows that parasitoid attraction to oviposition-induced plant volatiles is specific to coevolved plant–herbivore interactions and can be disrupted by concurrent attack from an alien herbivore, demonstrating that plant volatile-mediated signaling is sensitive to multiple herbivory and the coevolutionary history of interacting species.",
  "Across a Mexico-to-Bolivia transect, herbivore density and species richness on two Piper hosts increased toward the equator without increased damage, supporting stronger plant antiherbivore defenses at lower latitudes and proposing that generalist-driven herbivore pressure may elevate the abundance, diversity, and efficiency of qualitative chemical defenses at lower latitudes.",
  "The paper establishes a sequence where nitroketonic Michael adducts are converted to 1,4-diketones via a Nef reaction by generating a nitronate with sodium methoxide and then adding concentrated sulfuric acid at −50 °C, followed by base-promoted intramolecular cyclization to afford γ-functionalized cyclopentenones.",
  "An attention-guided, unsupervised Transformer model (RXNMapper) maps each product atom to a corresponding reactant atom and achieves 99.4% correct full atom-mappings on strongly unbalanced reactions, enabling reliable atom tracking between reaction steps.",
  "The paper establishes BIMP-catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated α,β-unsaturated esters as a direct route to enantioenriched γ-nitroesters, contextualizing prior Hayashi–Jørgensen nitromethane additions to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and demonstrating the first intermolecular example for esters with high selectivity and scalability.",
  "The study defines atom-to-atom mapping as the correspondence between reactant and product atoms, emphasizes that incorrect mappings propagate errors to downstream reaction-mining tasks, and reports RXNMapper as the most accurate tool among those benchmarked.",
  "Diphenylprolinol silyl ether—independently developed by Hayashi and Jørgensen—is used to mediate asymmetric Michael reactions in one-pot sequences, and the paper also exemplifies an oxidative Nef reaction using molecular oxygen within a multi-step one-pot synthesis.",
  "The study demonstrates a green, water-based visible-light protocol using rose bengal (10 mol% under 21 W white LED at elevated temperature) to couple indoles with nitroalkenes, forming 3-(2-nitroalkyl)indoles in up to 87% yield with a mechanistic rationale involving oxidation of an olefin to a radical cation, radical addition to the nitroalkene, reduction, and protonation, and confirms practicality via gram-scale synthesis.",
  "This review compiles methodologies for asymmetric, diastereoselective Henry reactions using higher nitroalkanes (e.g., nitroethane, nitropropane) to form chiral beta-nitro alcohols, detailing catalyst classes (rare-earth, copper, cobalt, and organocatalysts), conditions, and typical outcomes in enantioselectivity and syn/anti control.",
  "Under visible-light and aerobic conditions, triplet-state fluorescein participates in a reductive quenching cycle with TEOA to generate radical species and is regenerated by molecular oxygen; experimentally, intact fluorescein outperforms phenyl-ring-substituted derivatives, with amine and nitro substitutions showing the poorest photoredox catalytic performance due to intramolecular PET.",
  "The article presents ozonolysis of nitronate anions as an efficient route to convert nitro groups into carbonyl compounds, noting it is unsuitable for substrates with reactive carbon–carbon double bonds and that primary nitronates require slow, stoichiometric ozone addition to avoid overoxidation.",
  "The paper details a linear route from cis-2-butene-1,4-diol (11) through ozonolysis and nitroolefin formation (10), a Hayashi–Jørgensen-catalyzed addition to give adduct 7, Wittig conversion to diolefin 13, and a fluorescein/singlet-oxygen-initiated Nef reaction converting the nitro group into aldehyde 14, which is then elaborated to multifidene (1); notably, the Nef mechanism indicates that the aldehyde oxygen in 14 is introduced from molecular oxygen.",
  "- Atom mapping establishes one-to-one reactant–product atom correspondences; accounting for molecular symmetry by identifying topologically equivalent atoms (same atomic symbol and identical three-hop neighborhoods) addresses mapping ambiguities.",
  "This study establishes an experimental alpha-helix propensity scale showing Ala as the most favorable helix former and Gly as the least, and demonstrates that neutralizing acidic residues increases helix propensity: uncharged Glu (Glu0) is ~0.24 kcal/mol more favorable than Glu− (Glu2), and uncharged Asp (Asp0) is ~0.26 kcal/mol more favorable than Asp− (Asp2).",
  "Electrostatics and sequence charge patterning critically govern the phase behavior of an intrinsically disordered region: Ddx4’s phase separation is strongly salt-dependent (∼100 °C drop in UCST from 100 to 500 mM NaCl), and scrambling the distribution of charged blocks reduces condensation, demonstrating that both the magnitude and spatial arrangement of charges modulate IDR-driven interactions.",
  "In peptides, N-terminal identity strongly modulates helix stability: Asn is the most stabilizing N-cap among uncharged nonaromatic residues, with Ser and Gly also strong, and N-terminal acetylation confers stabilization roughly equivalent to N-terminal Asn, whereas C-cap substitutions have comparatively minor effects.",
  "In intrinsically disordered polyampholytes, conformational ensembles are governed by fraction of charged residues (FCR) and the κ parameter that quantifies linear charge patterning: low κ (well-mixed oppositely charged residues) counterbalances attractions and repulsions to yield random-coil-like behavior, whereas high κ (segregated charges) promotes hairpin-like semicompact conformations via long-range electrostatic attractions.",
  "Tethered kinase reactions are governed by the effective concentration set by intrinsically disordered linkers; both linker length and sequence features (including net charge and rigidity-promoting residues) alter IDR compaction, which in turn modulates phosphorylation rates that follow a Michaelis–Menten-like dependence on effective concentration.",
  "Phosphorylation in IDRs increases side-chain volume and typically introduces two negative charges (dianionic at physiological pH), while Asp/Glu phosphomimetics do not fully reproduce the electronegativity, hydration, and volumetric effects of a true phosphoryl group and thus may not accurately replicate its structural or functional consequences.",
  "The paper establishes that in intrinsically disordered linkers, higher charged-residue content yields expanded conformations with positive effective solvation volumes (ves), whereas charge-poor sequences are more compact with negative ves; ves is dictated by the primary sequence and can be modulated by phosphorylation, which alters charge and thereby changes phase separation and gelation behavior.",
  "In intrinsically disordered regions, phosphorylation (e.g., of serine/threonine) introduces additional negative charges and salt-bridge capability; the resulting conformational outcomes depend less on overall net charge and more on how phosphosites are distributed relative to nearby basic residues (Arg/Lys), whose long-range salt bridges can dominate compaction or expansion.",
  "For intrinsically disordered, low-hydrophobicity protein regions, increasing net charge per residue drives a transition from compact globules to expanded coils, establishing net charge per residue as a primary determinant of chain dimensions and conformational state.",
  "In intrinsically disordered and unfolded proteins, electrostatic interactions dominate chain dimensions at low ionic strength: higher net charge drives expansion via repulsion, charge screening (e.g., by salts) induces compaction, and balanced mixtures of positive and negative residues can promote additional collapse through attractive interactions between opposite charges.",
  "In single-chain proteins, linker composition (Ala/Ser/Gly) strongly determines stability and kinetics: composition matters more than sequence; optimal 19-residue randomized linkers were 11 Ala/5 Gly (Ala/Gly library) or 7 Ser/9 Gly (Ser/Gly library); alanine predominantly accelerates folding, serine predominantly slows unfolding (likely via hydrogen bonding), and excessive glycine-induced flexibility reduces stability.",
  "The study demonstrates that alanine has a high intrinsic helix propagation propensity across both standard and template-nucleated contexts, while charged and polar residues tend to destabilize helices; thus, helix stability can be increased by incorporating alanine relative to charged/polar side chains, with additional position-specific effects near template–peptide junctions.",
  "Increasing electrostatic charge segregation in an intrinsically disordered region—by creating blocks enriched in anionic and cationic residues instead of a well-mixed distribution—substantially raises phase-separation propensity and phase-transition temperatures.",
  "Experimentally, IDR/linker compaction is governed primarily by net charge and by the identity of charged residues: Glu/Asp increase expansion, Lys increases expansion even further, Arg increases expansion less and can engage in attractive interactions; hydrophobicity alone has little effect on compaction, whereas aromatic residues (e.g., tyrosine) produce strong compaction.",
  "Glycine–serine repeat linkers are favored in multidomain protein design because their flexible, hydrophilic composition minimizes secondary structure and domain interference; experimentally, reducing glycine content modestly increases linker stiffness, with measured persistence lengths progressing from 3.7 Å (G4S2) to 6.2 Å (all-serine).",
  "The paper defines N(n, r, k) as the number of binary words of length n starting with 0 that contain exactly k maximal runs of length r, and shows that their generating function is x^{kr} times the (k+1)st power of (1−x)/(1−2x+x^r−x^{r+1}); in the k=0 case, the generating function (1−x)/(1−2x+x^r−x^{r+1}) counts words avoiding runs of length r, and words with k runs decompose as alternating run-free segments and fixed-length runs, enabling convolution-based counting.",
  "The study analyzes recombination in terms of crossovers (the readily detectable outcome) and explicitly distinguishes single-recombinant (one crossover) from double-recombinant chromosomes, framing crossovers as the mechanism generating heritable genetic diversity across meioses.",
  "In advanced intercross lines derived from two inbred lines, the expected proportion of recombinant haplotypes between two loci increases with each intercross generation, approximated for closely linked loci by a t/2-fold increase relative to F2 and asymptotically approaching 0.5 over many generations.",
  "Meiotic recombination is initiated by DSBs, which can be repaired as either crossovers (reciprocal exchanges between homologous chromosomes) or non-crossovers; in mammals only about 10% of DSBs become crossovers.",
  "The paper establishes that palindromic binary strings avoiding r consecutive 1’s can be counted in closed form using r-Fibonacci sequences, constructing even-length palindromes by mirroring a length-m string and odd-length palindromes by mirroring around a central bit, with illustrative examples provided for r=2.",
  "Homologous recombination proceeds through Holliday junction intermediates whose isomerization and branch migration govern whether flanking DNA becomes recombinant or remains nonrecombinant and where the crossover is resolved, with heteroduplex regions potentially subject to mismatch repair.",
  "Conversion from laparoscopic to open appendectomy occurs with an overall rate of 9.51% in randomized trials, and open appendectomy is described as the long-standing standard treatment with favorable efficacy and safety.",
  "Stapler malfunctions can include device lock on tissue with failed manual override; the case report describes a powered Endo-GIA that froze and locked, requiring over 10 minutes to separate, and the literature cited notes that such failures have led to conversion to open procedures, with MAUDE data indicating 10.8% of failures involve an inability to release from tissue.",
  "Reported stapler malfunctions in bariatric surgery commonly include devices that will not open or cannot be removed from tissue; most events did not have clinical significance and cases were typically completed after replacing the device and continuing the operation.",
  "In a thoracoscopic lobectomy case where a stapler’s jaws remained stuck to tissue after firing and manufacturer-recommended release maneuvers failed, surgeons inserted a second stapler to divide tissue between the locked stapler and the pulmonary artery, then divided and removed the tissue containing the locked stapler using an energy device, allowing completion of the operation without air leak and with an unremarkable postoperative course.",
  "For appendiceal stump closure during appendectomy, endoloops/suture ligation or polymeric clips are recommended for both uncomplicated and complicated cases, with endostaplers as an option based on intra-operative judgment and resource availability; laparoscopy is preferred when feasible, but surgeons should maintain a low threshold for conversion when necessary.",
  "In a retrospective series of 36 adults with appendiceal base necrosis or perforation (Gomes stage 3B), laparoscopic partial cecum resection using an endostapler to include the appendiceal root within a safe margin was performed without intraoperative complications or stapler-line leaks, with a mean operative time of 104.75 minutes and mean hospital stay of 4.58 days.",
  "In adults, laparoscopic appendectomy reduces wound infections and overall postoperative complications, shortens postoperative stay and time to normal activity compared with open appendectomy, while having a longer operative time but similar rates of intra-abdominal abscess and reoperation.",
  "In a multicenter series of surgery for benign-appearing cecal polyps, most procedures were completed laparoscopically, but some required completion through a small laparotomy after laparoscopic mobilization or conversion to open surgery for complications such as perforation or bleeding.",
  "The review advises against forcibly disengaging a jammed stapler and recommends device-specific reversal/disassembly; if the device is irretrievable or tissue is compromised, conversion to a hand-sewn repair is the gold-standard salvage approach, particularly in anatomically constrained settings.",
  "In patients with prosthetic heart valves, combining an antiplatelet agent (aspirin or dipyridamole) with oral anticoagulation reduces thromboembolic events (OR 0.43) and mortality (OR 0.57) versus anticoagulation alone but increases major bleeding risk (OR 1.58); benefits apply to mechanical valves and high‑risk bioprosthetic valves, and low‑dose aspirin (≤100 mg) appears similarly effective with potentially lower bleeding risk.",
  "For mechanical heart valves, lifelong anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) remains necessary to prevent valve thrombosis, and DOACs are not approved for this indication due to inferior outcomes versus warfarin in major trials (e.g., dabigatran in RE-ALIGN, apixaban in PROACT-Xa).",
  "After heart valve surgery, antithrombotic strategies to prevent thrombotic events include lifelong VKA anticoagulation for mechanical heart valves, consideration of low-dose aspirin or VKA for the first 3 months after surgical aortic bioprosthesis implantation, and consideration of VKA for the first 3 months after mitral or tricuspid valve repair.",
  "Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor with established postoperative use for venous thromboembolism prevention (after orthopedic surgery), exhibits potent inhibition of thrombin activity at low nanomolar concentrations (IC50 ≈ 2.3 nM), and reaches peak plasma levels around 180 ng/ml (~350 nM) in clinical settings.",
  "Bovine anticoagulase antisera inhibit staphylococcal coagulase noncompetitively when unheated, but heating at 56°C for 30 minutes reduces inhibitory capacity and shifts the mechanism to competitive inhibition that can be reversed by increasing fibrinogen concentration.",
  "After surgical aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, AHA/ESC recommend 3 months of warfarin; observational data in this meta-analysis suggest lower 1-year and 3–12 month mortality with anticoagulation compared to antiplatelet or no therapy, but all antithrombotic regimens increase bleeding versus no medication, and overall evidence certainty is very low.",
  "Mechanical heart valve patients require lifelong oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin is the only approved option), and poorer anticoagulation control (lower time in therapeutic range) is associated with higher risks of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and death.",
  "After heart valve surgery, antithrombotic therapy is tailored to valve type: in the first 3 months, aortic bioprostheses receive aspirin (add clopidogrel if transcatheter), mitral bioprostheses receive VKA (INR target 2.5), mechanical valves require early bridging to VKA with UFH/LMWH followed by long-term VKA (INR 2.5 for aortic; 3.0 for mitral/double), and valve repairs receive aspirin.",
  "Staphylococcus aureus coagulases (Coa and vWbp) activate prothrombin to generate fibrin from fibrinogen and facilitate formation of a protective fibrin/fibrinogen shield; they differ in fibrinogen-binding sites and affinities, and simultaneous inhibition of both coagulase–fibrinogen interactions is proposed to prevent shield assembly.",
  "S. aureus coagulase forms staphylothrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin, leading to thromboembolic lesions and platelet activation; this staphylothrombin-mediated coagulation is not inhibited by common anticoagulants (e.g., heparin), although dabigatran and argatroban can inhibit it while posing bleeding risks.",
  "Bacterial intrinsic terminators require a G/C-rich RNA hairpin followed by a U-tract; termination proceeds through pausing, hairpin nucleation, hairpin completion (with weak rU–dA base pairs aiding RNA release), and transcription-bubble rewinding, culminating in RNA and then DNA release.",
  "The E. coli trp attenuation mechanism relies on competing RNA structures: the 3-4 stem-loop functions as the terminator hairpin essential for transcription termination, while formation of the alternative 2-3 stem-loop excludes 3-4 and relieves termination; under high tryptophan, ribosomes mask regions 1 and 2, preventing 1-2 and 2-3 pairings and thereby allowing 3-4 to form and trigger termination.",
  "The study demonstrates in vivo synthesis of the E. coli trp operon leader peptide and supports models in which translation of a 14-codon leader region—containing two consecutive tryptophan codons—plays a central role in regulating transcription termination at an attenuator within the leader region.",
  "Intrinsic terminators typically require an RNA hairpin for function, and while a U-rich tract downstream is common, it is not essential; experimentally, deletion of the terminator hairpin abolishes intrinsic termination on both double- and single-stranded DNA templates.",
  "The trp leader’s 3′ region can form two alternative hairpins; the second hairpin forms under tryptophan excess and causes termination, and mutations that destabilize this second hairpin relieve termination, whereas destabilizing only the first hairpin increases termination.",
  "Effective intrinsic (rho-independent) termination in E. coli requires two adjacent RNA features: a stable terminator hairpin and an immediately downstream run of approximately 6–8 uridine residues; experimentally, deleting the hairpin eliminates termination, underscoring that both elements are necessary.",
  "In the E. coli trp leader, formation of the 2:3 antiterminator prevents the 3:4 terminator hairpin; release of the ribosome at the leader stop codon allows occasional 2:3 formation that accounts for basal readthrough, and continued translation through the terminator region would block termination.",
  "Intrinsic termination requires a GC-rich RNA hairpin immediately followed by a 7–9 nt U-rich tract; the U-tract adjacent to the hairpin mediates pausing and destabilization of the RNA/DNA hybrid, and sequences lacking a U-tract do not function as intrinsic terminators even with NusA or NusG present.",
  "A C→T mutation at bp 117 in the trp leader (trpL117) decreases attenuator terminator stability and increases trp operon expression three- to fourfold even under excess tryptophan, indicating that destabilizing the terminator permits continued transcription when tryptophan is abundant.",
  "In E. coli trp attenuation, segments 1–4 of the leader RNA can form either a 2:3 antiterminator (blocking 3:4 formation and allowing readthrough at low tryptophan) or a 3:4 terminator hairpin followed by an 8-residue poly(U) tract (driving termination at high tryptophan when a ribosome covers segments 1 and 2).",
  "Single base-pair mutations in the GC-rich segment of the trp leader that destabilize the second stem-loop (residues +114 to +134) lead to reduced termination at the attenuator and increased readthrough in vitro (46–76% vs. 5% wild type), indicating that formation of this stem-loop is critical for transcription termination.",
  "Harlequin ichthyosis presents with bilateral ectropion and eclabium alongside generalized thick hyperkeratotic scaling and limb contractures; as the encased stratum corneum sheds, patients exhibit diffuse erythema with finer scaling.",
  "In a prospective Tanzanian cohort of 228 pediatric cataract cases, cataract is identified as a leading avoidable cause of childhood blindness in low-income countries; 38% of children presented before age 1 year; and the authors conclude that sutureless surgery appears safe for children older than 1 year.",

  "In adult dermatomyositis, anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies occur in a subset of patients (reported 2–45% in literature; 19.5% in this Brazilian cohort), and dermatomyositis is an autoimmune myopathy that primarily affects the skin and skeletal muscle.",
  "McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is defined by fibrous dysplasia with extraskeletal features that can include café-au-lait macules and hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies (e.g., precocious puberty, hyperthyroidism, growth hormone excess, FGF23-mediated phosphate wasting, or Cushing’s), with café-au-lait spots often present at or shortly after birth and Cushing’s syndrome—when it occurs—presenting in the neonatal period.",
  "McArdle disease (glycogen storage disease type V) typically presents in childhood with exercise intolerance and frequent episodes of rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria; creatine phosphokinase (CPK) often remains elevated at rest, and diagnosis commonly uses serum CPK levels, ischemic forearm exercise testing, muscle biopsy, and molecular genetic studies.",

  "Congenital/childhood cataracts are an important pediatric condition that may be associated with extra-ocular comorbidities; they are screened for via red-reflex assessment (absence suggests lens opacity) and require prompt referral because untreated dense cataracts lead to irreversible sensory-deprivation amblyopia.",
  "Harlequin ichthyosis is characterized by diffuse hyperkeratotic plaques and is classically associated with severe ectropion, which was also observed clinically (bilateral ectropion) in the reported pediatric case.",
  "Harlequin ichthyosis is associated with ectropion (outward turning of the eyelids), demonstrated in a case infant with open eyes due to eyelid eversion, and early systemic retinoid therapy may reduce scales and improve ectropion.",

  "Dermatomyositis exhibits distinct clinical-serologic subsets: anti-Mi-2 is linked to predominantly cutaneous features (e.g., Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash), while in juvenile DM anti-Mi-2 positivity is less frequent (5–10%) and anti-NXP2 is associated with severe calcinosis, muscle atrophy, and joint contractures.",
  "Solanaceae plants do not detect R. solanacearum flagellin-derived peptides (flg22Rsol, flgII-28Rsol) in ROS assays, whereas the csp22Rsol peptide elicits immune responses in specific Solanaceae; Arabidopsis lacks csp22Rsol responsiveness but gains it, along with increased resistance to R. solanacearum, when expressing the tomato csp22 receptor SlCORE; ROS measurements are performed using luminol/L-012 assays over 60 minutes and reported as RLUs.",
  "In Nicotiana benthamiana, the LRR-RLP NbCSPR mediates csp22 perception in a BAK1-dependent manner; Arabidopsis lacks endogenous csp22 responsiveness and an identifiable CSPR homolog, but introducing NbCSPR enables csp22-triggered immune outputs and enhances antibacterial resistance.",
  "The study describes a luminol-based microplate assay to quantify flg22-induced extracellular ROS in plants, noting that flg22 perception by the FLS2 receptor triggers apoplastic ROS; luminescence (RLU) is recorded over a 60-minute period with defined measurement intervals.",
  "Ligand-activated LRR receptor kinases rapidly form complexes with BAK1 and undergo de novo phosphorylation; BAK1 kinase activity is essential for downstream immune outputs such as ROS, and bak1 mutants exhibit reduced responses to multiple elicitors, including cold shock protein.",
  "In Arabidopsis, the flagellin-derived PAMP flg22 triggers a rapid ROS burst measurable over 60 minutes by a luminol-based assay; this response depends on the NADPH oxidase RBOHD—which becomes phosphorylated in vivo upon flagellin—and is central to early immune signaling.",
  "In Solanaceae, plasma membrane-localized PRR complexes (e.g., RLKs such as FLS2, FLS3, and CORE) perceive extracellular MAMPs and, upon ligand binding, heterodimerize with the co-receptor BAK1 to initiate PTI signaling that includes reactive oxygen species production.",
  "BIK1 is a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase that associates with the FLS2–BAK1 flagellin receptor complex and is rapidly phosphorylated in an FLS2- and BAK1-dependent manner; BAK1 functions as a shared co-receptor required for immune responses to multiple MAMPs, including cold-shock protein, positioning BIK1 as an early transducer linking receptor complexes to intracellular signaling.",
  "- Arabidopsis FLS2 directly binds the flagellin epitope flg22 and, when expressed in tomato cells, confers Arabidopsis-type flg22 perception, establishing FLS2 as the pattern-recognition receptor that determines the specificity of flagellin recognition.",
  "Arabidopsis perceives MAMPs via transmembrane PRRs; flg22 is recognized by the FLS2 receptor (with fls2 mutants losing flg22 responses while retaining OG responsiveness), and late SA-dependent defenses such as PR1 are significantly induced by flg22 but not by OGs despite broadly similar early responses.",
  "SERK3/BAK1 functions as a conserved PTI component: it rapidly associates with the flagellin receptor FLS2 upon elicitation and is required for early flg22-triggered responses in Arabidopsis, while in Nicotiana benthamiana it is also necessary for AOS responses to other PAMPs such as CSP22 and INF1, indicating a shared role across multiple PRR pathways.",
  "In Arabidopsis innate immunity, perception of microbial patterns such as flagellin by FLS2 triggers formation of an FLS2–BAK1 receptor complex; the RLCK BIK1 associates with this complex, is phosphorylated by BAK1, and dissociates upon ligand perception, and MAMP recognition leads to early responses including reactive oxygen species production.",
  "Arabidopsis FLS2, a plasma membrane receptor-like kinase, perceives the flagellin epitope flg22 to rapidly trigger ROS and undergoes ligand- and activation-dependent endocytosis into intracellular vesicles followed by degradation, consistent with regulation of PRR activity via subcellular trafficking.",
  "For adults ≤75 years with clinical ASCVD, initiate or continue high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥50%; in very high-risk ASCVD, if LDL-C remains ≥70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin, adding ezetimibe is reasonable.",
  "In ACS patients, an early intensive simvastatin strategy (40 mg for 1 month then 80 mg) compared with delayed initiation of 20 mg was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the composite endpoint overall, significant reductions in cardiovascular death and new-onset heart failure, and a 0.4% incidence of myopathy confined to the 80 mg dose.",
  "In adults ≤75 years with clinical ASCVD, the pathway emphasizes first ensuring a high-intensity statin (or increasing to it if on low/moderate intensity); if on maximally tolerated statin and LDL-C remains ≥70 mg/dL, ezetimibe is the recommended initial nonstatin add-on.",
  "Per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction, statins cut major vascular events by about 21% and vascular mortality by 12%, with absolute benefits in low-risk individuals (~11 fewer major vascular events per 1000 over 5 years) that outweigh known hazards.",
  "More intensive LDL-cholesterol lowering with statins yields additional, definite reductions in major vascular events—including a 16% reduction in ischaemic stroke—with each 1.0 mmol/L LDL decrease lowering major events by just over a fifth, without evidence of a lower threshold; thus, in high-risk patients, treatment should aim for the largest feasible LDL reduction while monitoring myopathy risk.",
  "For secondary prevention, aspirin 75–162 mg daily is recommended for all patients with CAD (clopidogrel if aspirin-intolerant); dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor plus aspirin is indicated only after ACS or PCI with stent placement, whereas patients with extracranial carotid or vertebral atherosclerosis and prior ischemic stroke/TIA should receive antiplatelet monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) or aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole.",
  "For adults ≤75 years with clinical ASCVD (which includes prior ischemic stroke), the guideline recommends initiating or increasing to high-intensity statin therapy; high-intensity options are atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg.",
  "For powdered parenteral drugs, use sterile diluents (often sterile water or normal saline) exactly as specified by the manufacturer, verify instructions rather than assuming, record the post-reconstitution concentration for accurate dosing, and ensure hazardous agents like chemotherapeutics are reconstituted by trained pharmacy personnel in a chemical fume hood or equivalent containment with appropriate PPE.",
  "In the Head Start 4 trial, switching from BSA-based to mg/kg dosing for children under 6 years was associated with elimination of observed SOS cases during induction (0/75 after amendment), leading authors to recommend caution with BSA dosing for intensive chemotherapy in this age group.",
  "The guideline notes that traditional pediatric maintenance water needs were derived from energy expenditure (1 mL per kcal, approximately 1500 mL/m²/day), emphasizes that additional free-water sources such as enteral intake or IV medications can contribute to hyponatremia risk even when isotonic maintenance IVFs are used, and clarifies that the recommendations do not apply to children with cancer.",
  "For pediatric routine maintenance IV fluids, NICE recommends calculating daily volume using the Holliday–Segar formula (100 ml/kg/day for the first 10 kg, 50 ml/kg/day for the next 10 kg, 20 ml/kg/day for weight over 20 kg) based on body weight, and monitoring fluid balance by recording all types and volumes of inputs and outputs hourly with running totals.",
  "Dose banding uses predefined BSA ranges to assign standard doses and, across six cytotoxics studied, achieved AUC precision comparable to BSA-based dosing (with an exception for paclitaxel), while BSA-based dosing outperformed fixed-dose strategies for four of six drugs.",
  "Pediatric maintenance IV fluids should be calculated using the 4-2-1 (100-50-20) rule—4 mL/kg/hr for the first 10 kg, 2 mL/kg/hr for the next 10 kg, and 1 mL/kg/hr for each kg over 20 kg (maximum 120 mL/hr); maintenance IV rates should not exceed the calculated maintenance, replacement of ongoing losses is calculated separately, and IV fluids should be discontinued when adequate enteral intake is achieved.",
  "In acidic aqueous media, O,O,O-orthoesters undergo irreversible hydrolysis to esters; their hydrolysis rate is strongly dependent on pH and substituents, with electron-rich variants hydrolyzing rapidly even at neutral pH, which is why exchange reactions must be conducted under anhydrous conditions.",
  "- Orthoesters undergo general acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to ring-opened esters; TFA is used as a catalyst for orthoester exchange, and in aqueous buffer electron-rich orthoesters hydrolyze readily even at neutral pH, whereas electron-deficient variants (e.g., triazolium, CCl3) can remain stable with half-lives beyond 16 hours even at pH 1.",
  "Ortho-ester-containing POEA polymers exhibit acid-labile degradation in aqueous media, with experiments showing near zero-order, surface-erosion-driven mass loss that is markedly faster at mildly acidic pH (complete erosion by day 10 at pH 5.0) compared to physiological pH (about 20% mass loss after 14 days).",
  "Under aqueous mildly acidic conditions (pH ~5), the paper’s ortho ester side-chains undergo rapid acid-catalyzed exocyclic cleavage that releases ethanol and butyrolactone (which promptly opens to hydroxybutyric acid) and converts the polymer side-chain to hydroxyethyl methacrylate; hydrolysis is minimal at pH 7.4 but essentially complete within hours at pH ~5.",
  "Under acidic aqueous conditions, acetals hydrolyze to carbonyl compounds and orthoesters to esters; consequently, orthoester exchange is fundamentally incompatible with water and typically requires strictly anhydrous conditions or excess orthoester to quench residual water.",
  "Under specific acid-catalyzed conditions in water, cyclic orthoesters hydrolyze via a three-stage mechanism to form acyclic hydroxy esters, and the hydrolysis rate increases linearly with acid concentration.",
  "For chi-square tests of independence on contingency tables, standard assumptions require adequate expected frequencies (no more than 20% of cells with expected counts below 5 and no zero-count cells); violating these conditions increases type I error rates for chi-square, in which case Fisher’s exact test is preferred; the degrees of freedom for a contingency table are (r − 1) × (c − 1).",
  "In a goodness-of-fit test with k categories and no estimated parameters, the test statistic T = Σ[(Xi − n·pi)^2/(n·pi)] is approximately χ2-distributed with k−1 degrees of freedom, and the null hypothesis is rejected when T exceeds the right-tail critical value for the chosen significance level.",
  "The review of a Mendel source book notes a careful, closer-to-original translation of Mendel’s pea paper, clarifies that ‘wrinkled’ versus ‘angular’ seed phenotypes should not be confused (both arising from starch-grain differences), and highlights the inclusion of Sewell Wright’s criticism of Fisher’s statistical analysis of Mendel’s experiments.",
  "Mendel’s dihybrid and trihybrid results adhered to independent assortment: in multihybrid crosses, each pair of traits behaves independently (combination series), and departures from this expectation are defined as significant deviations indicative of linkage.",
  "The paper provides a practical 0.05 significance rule for chi-square tests via the Wilson–Hilferty cube-root normal approximation and lists true χ2 critical values (e.g., at P=0.05, χ2 = 7.815 for 3 df and 18.307 for 10 df), facilitating hypothesis testing without full tables.",
  "Under the null hypothesis with k categories, the chi-square statistic comparing observed counts to expected counts has an asymptotic chi-square distribution with (k − 1) degrees of freedom when expectations are fully specified; if s parameters are estimated from the data, the degrees of freedom reduce to (k − s − 1), and practical application commonly recommends minimum expected counts per class of at least 5–10.",
  "For contingency tables, chi-square significance must be evaluated using degrees of freedom based on linear constraints (e.g., for an r by c table, df = (r−1)(c−1), corresponding to n' = (c−1)(r−1)+1 for table lookup), a correction that can markedly change the resulting P-value.",
  "Pearson (1900) presents a goodness-of-fit approach where, for (n+1) grouped categories with known theoretical frequencies, only n errors are variable; a statistic X^2 is computed from the deviations, and P is interpreted as the probability that deviations at least as large would arise by random sampling—very small P values (illustrated by P ≈ 0.000016 in a dice example) justify concluding the model does not fit.",
  "The electrotopological state (E-state) assigns each atom a value Si formed by adding an intrinsic atom value Ii—given for first-row atoms by I = (6' + 1)/6—to a perturbation term AIi that sums electronic influences from all other atoms with magnitude decreasing by the square of the graph separation rij, thereby integrating electronic character and molecular topology into a single atom-level index.",
  "The electrotopological state (E-state) of an atom is defined as S_i = I_i + AI_i, where AI_i sums (I_i − I_j)/r^2 over all other atoms j using graph separation r, providing a non-empirical index that unifies electronic (intrinsic electron-count-based I_i) and topological (distance-dependent) molecular information.",
  "Intermolecular Heck reactions, as characterized here, couple a monosubstituted alkene with an aryl or vinyl halide (or triflate) under palladium catalysis and base to form aryl/vinyl–alkene C–C bonds, yielding branched (α) or linear (β) products depending on conditions and pathway.",
  "Kier-Hall E-states are atom-level electrotopological indices defined across 35 predefined atom types (covering C, N, O, S, and halogens), where the type labels encode bonding context using s/d/t/a to denote single/double/triple/aromatic environments.",
  "The standard Heck reaction (as established in 1972) couples an organohalide—exemplified by an aryl halide—with an olefin under Pd(0) catalysis, initiated by oxidative addition of RX to palladium and proceeding via olefin coordination, migratory insertion, and β-hydride elimination to form a substituted alkene.",
  "Geary’s c measures spatial autocorrelation via weighted squared differences; its multivariate extension defines a global c as a weighted sum of squared Euclidean differences between standardized multivariate observations and, by construction, generalizes the univariate measure (reducing to it when p=1 and equaling the simple average of univariate c values).",
  "DesMol2 computes Kier–Hall connectivity indices (up to fourth order) and provides quotients/differences between valence and non-valence connectivity indices; its SMILES outputs can be directly used in Dragon to calculate additional topological descriptors.",
  "Geary’s c is defined on a weighted graph and can be expressed as a weighted average over Laplacian-eigenvector-specific values c(uk), with nonnegative weights summing to one; the c(uk) are ordered and average to 1, which implies any c(y) lies within [c(u2), c(un)].",
  "The paper situates Kier and Hall’s valence connectivity indices (derived from the original connectivity index and its higher-order forms) within a broader framework by defining a variable connectivity index that replaces the classic bond contribution 1/√(mn) with 1/√[(m+x)(n+y)], thereby providing a flexible generalization that can be viewed as an unlimited collection of valence connectivity indices through variable atom-type weighting.",
  "The paper’s descriptor glossary specifies that ‘e’ weighting in autocorrelation descriptors corresponds to atomic Sanderson electronegativities (e.g., MATS6e), and it defines X3A and X3A V as the average connectivity index chi-3 and the average valence connectivity index chi-3, respectively.",
  "Kier and Hall molecular connectivity indices mχk quantify structural fragments of order m and type k (path, cluster, path-cluster), while replacing the connectivity degree δi with its valence form δνi yields valence indices mχνk that explicitly account for heteroatom effects; thus, valence (χν) and non-valence (χ) indices of the same order differ in whether heteroatom information is encoded.",
  "The paper defines Geary autocorrelation descriptors (GATSie) as 2D autocorrelation indices where the Geary coefficient is a distance-type function computed using atomic properties; examples include GATS1e (lag 1, weighted by atomic Sanderson electronegativities) and GATS6e (lag 6, weighted by Sanderson electronegativity).",
  "The study uses topological descriptors including (1) valence topological charge indices based on an electronegativity-modified adjacency matrix and (2) quotients/differences between valence and non-valence connectivity indices, and identifies X0v (valence connectivity index) alongside JGI4, GGI7, and Mv as significant predictors in its final regression model.",
  "Beating sheets are designed to dislodge arthropods from vegetation and are particularly effective for beetles, true bugs, and larval Lepidoptera; organisms inhabiting ground litter (e.g., in leaf mold or rotting wood) typically require sifters, and aquatic taxa require specialized aquatic equipment, indicating these latter groups are not well sampled by beating vegetation.",
  "Beat sheets collect insects that are resting/feeding on vegetation (typically trees and shrubs), effectively sampling caterpillars and other plant-feeding, tree/shrub-dwelling taxa, but they are poor for flying insects that often escape when branches are struck.",
  "Honeybee immatures (larvae) are immobile and reside within brood cells in the hive as completely dependent colony members, indicating their study requires in situ, colony-based approaches rather than field collection from vegetation.",
  "Within Entimini (Entiminae), most larvae feed externally on roots, indicating a predominantly root-zone (not foliage) habitat that would not be effectively sampled by a beat-sheet method.",
  "In both honeybees (Apis mellifera) and stingless bees (Meliponini), immatures (larvae and pupae) develop within brood cells inside the nest—honeybee brood are removed from sealed cells during hygienic behavior, and stingless bees rear brood in sealed cells that are subsequently torn down—indicating these immatures are nest-contained rather than exposed on vegetation.",
  "The paper documents that many Histeridae occupy concealed habitats: cylindrical forms (e.g., Niponiinae, Trypanaeinae, Trypeticinae) inhabit wood-boring beetle galleries, while broadly oval lineages (e.g., Onthophilinae and other Histeromorphae) are often associated with mammal nests, decaying organic matter, or live as symbionts in ant and termite nests; these ecological patterns indicate frequent occurrence away from vegetation.",
  "Honey bee larvae were produced and collected within active colonies by isolating a laying queen on a brood comb frame and then sampling larvae daily from the comb for five days post-hatching, confirming that Apis immatures occur inside hives on brood comb tended by workers.",
  "In rat central amygdala slices, low-to-moderate ethanol acutely increases GABAA IPSPs/IPSCs via both presynaptic (increased mIPSC frequency, reduced paired-pulse facilitation) and postsynaptic (enhanced responses to exogenous GABA) mechanisms; related behavioral data indicate that GABAergic antagonists in the CeA reduce ethanol self-administration, consistent with ethanol’s enhancement of GABAergic inhibition reducing CeA output.",
  "Alcohol-preferring rats exhibit decreased GAT-3 expression in the amygdala and increased GABAergic tone with elevated tonic inhibition in the central amygdala, and within this circuit GABA_A receptor agonists promote while antagonists inhibit alcohol self-administration.",
  "Astrocytic glutamate uptake can reverse glial GABA transporters (GAT-2/3), releasing GABA into the extrasynaptic space to increase tonic inhibition via GABAA receptors; pharmacological blockade of GAT-2/3 reduces this tonic inhibition during enhanced network activity and prolongs seizure-like events, indicating that active GAT-2/3 elevates extracellular GABA to restrain neuronal excitability.",
  "In ethanol-dependent rats, the central amygdala exhibits increased basal GABAergic transmission (elevated evoked IPSP/IPSC amplitudes and reduced paired-pulse facilitation) and a roughly fourfold rise in extracellular GABA, while prior work shows that blocking GABAA receptors in this region reduces ethanol self-administration.",
  "Tonic GABAA conductance—crucial for regulating neuronal excitability—depends on ambient GABA from both vesicular (synaptic) and non-vesicular sources, with mGAT1 primarily limiting synaptic spillover and mGAT3/4 predominantly regulating non-vesicular extracellular GABA.",
  "In rats, compulsive alcohol drinking (quinine-resistant) is associated with reduced GAT-3 (Slc6a11) mRNA in the central amygdala; because GABA transporters regulate extracellular GABA and their downregulation increases GABAergic tone in the CeA, systemic baclofen (a GABAB receptor agonist) reduced voluntary alcohol intake overall and selectively suppressed compulsive alcohol drinking in the vulnerable subgroup.",
  "In alcohol-preferring rats, co-infusion of GABAA, GABAB, or 5-HT3 receptor antagonists into the nucleus accumbens shell significantly reduces ethanol self-infusion and active lever responding, indicating that ethanol’s local reinforcing effects depend on activation of these receptors within this region.",
  "The paper reports ex vivo slice electrophysiology conducted in the context of 'IoF' exposure, with comparisons across conditions repeatedly denoted in the text as 'no|oznoz' and 'z{zno|oznoz.'",
  "In central amygdala neurons, ethanol and CRF enhance presynaptic GABA release through a CRF1 receptor–PKCε signaling mechanism; genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PKCε abolishes these effects, and this pathway is linked to regulation of anxiety-like behavior and alcohol consumption.",
  "In this study, Wistar rats overwhelmingly chose alcohol over social interaction (e.g., 87% in one cohort; elsewhere 92.5% of males and 94% of females), while prior work cited by the authors showed that only about 15% of outbred Wistar rats chose alcohol over a sweet saccharin solution, highlighting a strong dependence of alcohol choice on the nature of the alternative reward.",
  "In hippocampal CA3 interneurons, tonic GABAA conductance is depolarizing and exerts a biphasic influence on neuronal and network dynamics: low ambient GABA (weak tonic conductance) increases interneuron firing and enhances oscillation power, while higher ambient GABA (strong tonic conductance) produces shunting inhibition that reduces firing and decreases oscillation power.",
  "Selective reduction of tonic GABAA inhibition (with phasic inhibition unchanged) elevates CA3 network excitability in alpha5 subunit–deficient mice, and low-dose muscimol restores tonic inhibition to wild-type levels while reducing hyperexcitability without altering phasic currents.",
  "In rat hippocampus, extracellular GABA determines tonic GABA_A receptor-mediated inhibition; both GAT-1 and astrocytic GAT-3 regulate e[GABA], and simultaneous blockade elevates e[GABA] supra-additively, increasing tonic conductance and thereby influencing network excitability.",
  "In rat neocortex, blocking GAT-3 with SNAP-5114 enhances inhibitory interneuron output and evoked GABAA responses, with the study proposing that GAT-3 normally contributes to ambient extracellular GABA via carrier-mediated (nonvesicular) release; inhibiting GAT-3 reduces ambient GABA and tonic inhibition onto inhibitory interneurons, thereby increasing their excitability and boosting inhibitory signaling.",
  "In E. coli, co-expression of disulfide bond catalysts (DsbA/B/C/D) and periplasmic chaperones/foldases (e.g., FkpA, DegP, SurA) frequently increases the yield and activity of disulfide-bonded recombinant proteins; additionally, spectinomycin-selectable SHuffle strains provide cytoplasmic DsbC and permit co-transformation alongside commonly used expression vectors.",
  "In E. coli, a bicistronic design (BCD) places a short upstream cistron (RBS1-driven) ahead of the target ORF with an internal RBS2, creating translational coupling that can overcome 5'-UTR/RBS accessibility issues via ribosome helicase activity and typically boosts heterologous protein expression relative to monocistronic designs, with increases ranging from at least twofold up to 10–100-fold for low-expressing codon variants.",
  "In Escherichia coli, compatible plasmids occupy independent cellular locations, indicating they can be co-maintained without interfering with each other—an organizational principle that supports multi-plasmid co-expression strategies.",
  "In E. coli coexpression, a two-promoter single-plasmid design increases expression of the second gene and avoids dual-vector copy-number dominance, yielding 4–9× more protein complex than bicistronic vectors and being described by the authors as a significant improvement and the method of first choice for obtaining protein complexes.",
  "Coexistence of multiple plasmids within a single bacterial host is common and can lead to diverse interaction outcomes—such as fertility inhibition or modulation of burden—so overall fitness effects may be either exacerbated or mitigated depending on the specific plasmid combination.",
  "In E. coli, plasmid-based heterologous protein expression imposes a metabolic burden whose magnitude is influenced by plasmid copy number, gene content, and promoter strength, leading to a trade-off between growth (biomass yield) and product formation.",
  "Novagen Duet vectors are designed for coexpression in E. coli by using four compatible plasmid backbones (pACYC low-copy, pCOLA/pCDF medium-copy, pET high-copy), all regulated by T7 lac promoters in lDE3 hosts; when multiple T7-driven plasmids are coexpressed, T7 RNAP can be sequestered, disproportionately reducing expression from lower-copy plasmids.",
  "E. coli GroEL and GroES are essential chaperones that can bind nascent polypeptides during translation and subsequently encapsulate them post-translationally to promote proper folding; elevating GroEL/GroES levels can compensate for the absence of other co-translational chaperones such as trigger factor and DnaK.",
  "Stable co-maintenance of two plasmids in the same E. coli cell requires heterologous replicons (compatible plasmids); isologous replicons are inherently incompatible and will segregate regardless of selection, whereas compatible pairs maintain their copy numbers even under changing selection conditions.",
  "In E. coli BL21(DE3), GroEL/GroES were co-expressed from arabinose-controlled plasmids while target proteins were induced from a T7 promoter with IPTG; increasing chaperonin levels improved solubility of aggregation-prone substrates by approximately 2- to 3-fold, and co-expression of both GroEL and GroES also restored solubility of these proteins in yeast.",
  "ColE1 and p15A plasmids are compatible in E. coli; they share a ~980 ± 43 bp region that includes the entire ColE1 replication region and extends ~400 bp downstream, with compatibility likely arising from differences in upstream sequences previously implicated in incompatibility.",
  "In TCR-transgenic mouse models, individual T cells can co-express two functional TCRs via two different α chains pairing with a common β chain, enabling responsiveness to distinct peptide-MHC complexes; human data further indicate that dual α-chain expression may be relatively common (~1/3 of T cells).",
  "In a physiological Tcra knock-in model permitting secondary rearrangements, self-antigen did not induce TCRα editing; instead, autoreactive thymocytes were eliminated by negative selection, while some secondary TCRα rearrangements occurred independently of antigen.",
  "In normal mice, a substantial subset of mature B cells (~10%) coexpress two κ light chains due to receptor editing rather than failed allelic exclusion; many of these dual-expressing B cells are autoreactive (>30%) yet can bear two receptors on the cell surface and participate in immune responses.",
  "Receptor editing during central B-cell tolerance can produce haplotype-included B cells that coexpress two light chains; some of these cells are selected into the mature peripheral pool, and approximately 3%–10% of wild-type peripheral B cells coexpress two light chains, with evidence that these cells are enriched for autoreactivity.",
  "Ambient (cell-free) RNA contamination is a ubiquitous and non-negligible artifact in droplet-based scRNA-seq that can misattribute lineage-specific transcripts to the wrong cell types (e.g., immunoglobulin genes in T cells), with contamination quantified at ~1–2% in species-mixing controls and ~5% in a PBMC dataset; doublets are also recognized as a separate common technical issue.",
  "In the 10x droplet scRNA-seq platform, multiplet rates are measurable (about 1.6% at low cell loads and increasing linearly with recovered cell numbers to roughly 9% at ~9,000 cells per channel), while barcode cross-talk is low on average (~0.9% of UMIs from other species); multiplets can be enriched for same-type T cells and are difficult to detect when cell types are highly similar.",
  "During thymocyte development, TCR alpha genes undergo multiple and ongoing rearrangements—even after surface TCRα/β expression—allowing loss/replacement of the original alpha chain; cells can harbor two in-frame alpha rearrangements with surface expression regulated (e.g., by competitive pairing with TCRβ).",
  "In normal B cell development, receptor editing is common and often inactivates previously functional kappa light chain rearrangements via RS recombination (with nearly half of RS-inactivated VkJk joins being in-frame), indicating that autoantigen-driven signals can transiently overcome allelic exclusion to alter BCR specificity.",
  "Droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq frequently produces multiplets at several-percent rates due to cell co-encapsulation or aggregates, with doublets constituting >97% of multiplets in experiments with overall multiplet rates below 5%.",
  "In mice, incomplete allelic exclusion at the TCR-α locus yields a measurable dual-α T cell population—approximately 10% of peripheral T cells express two cell-surface TCR-α chains—and such dual-α cells are proposed to contribute to autoimmunity when a second, low-density receptor allows escape from negative selection.",
  "The review establishes that multiple T cell lineages (nTreg, iNKT, CD8αα+ nIEL, nTh17) undergo agonist selection in the thymus, exhibiting higher self-reactivity than conventional naïve T cells and sharing a unifying requirement for strong TCR signals during development.",
  "In droplet-based scRNA-seq, two cells can be co-encapsulated into a single droplet, producing 'doublets' whose occurrence rate depends on input cell concentration and follows Poisson statistics; these technical artifacts can confound downstream analyses by mixing transcripts from distinct cells.",
  "This study shows that TCR β-chain allelic exclusion is tight, while TCR α-chain allelic exclusion is less stringent—with documented T-cell clones bearing two functional α chains—and that TCR engagement with self-MHC during positive selection down-regulates RAG-1 in cortical thymocytes, preventing further TCR α-chain rearrangements.",
  "Simpson (1949) defines a concentration measure λ = Σx_i^2, interpretable as the probability that two randomly chosen individuals are from the same group, and shows that its unbiased sample estimator is I = Σn_i(n_i−1)/[N(N−1)], with the numerator and denominator corresponding to counts of same-group pairs and all possible pairs in the sample, respectively.",
  "Hurlbert interprets the complement of Simpson’s concentration (1 − Σ pi^2) as a probability of interspecific encounter that ranges from 0 to 1, and notes that its sample estimators (D1, D2) are consistent and unbiased under random sampling.",
  "Observed diversity outcomes from field sampling can be strongly affected by sampling effort and methodology; valid comparisons require taxon sampling curves (e.g., rarefaction/accumulation) and, ideally, asymptotes, because raw counts or unstandardized measures may underestimate true diversity and lead to misleading conclusions.",
  "Because species are often not detected even when present, naive observations can underestimate true occupancy; model-based estimates that account for detection (e.g., 0.49 vs. 0.34 for American toads) demonstrate that nondetection does not equate to absence.",
  "Island communities exhibit high immigration and extinction rates leading to substantial turnover; species compositions can differ from earlier states, and more distant islands may take longer to reattain prior species numbers, so observed richness at a given time may be lower than historical levels despite valid sampling.",
  "Experimental defaunation of small mangrove islands followed by monitoring showed that species richness rose from empty conditions to near pre-defaunation levels within ~250 days for most islands, supporting a dynamic equilibrium in island species numbers and revealing high daily turnover rates (observed 0.05–0.50 species/day; ≥0.67 species/day as a lower limit), even while overall richness stabilizes.",
  "Immediately after experimental defaunation, some islands had zero living animals detected, but over time colonization proceeded toward a dynamic equilibrium number of species, indicating that island species richness can transiently be zero yet trend toward a predictable equilibrium.",
  "In this framework, Simpson diversity (q = 2) is defined as the inverse Simpson concentration (1/∑ p_i^2), interpreted as an effective number of species that emphasizes common species and exhibits less under-sampling bias than richness.",
  "Across Arabidopsis thaliana populations, transposable element insertions frequently produce new, large-effect alleles at adaptive loci (e.g., FLC), demonstrating that the mobilome is a pervasive, species-wide source of functional genetic variation.",
  "The study argues and demonstrates that transposable elements can rapidly generate genetic and phenotypic variation—and are enriched and functionally impactful in Capsella rubella—thereby offering a mechanism to promote adaptive phenotypic change even in species with severely reduced genetic variation.",
  "In Drosophila, chromosome ends naturally lose 70–80 bp per generation, and specialized telomeric retrotransposons (HeT-A, TART, TAHRE) transpose to telomeres to protect them from shortening, indicating an intrinsic genome architecture where TEs maintain chromosome integrity in place of telomerase.",
  "The paper explains that chromosomal inversions suppress recombination only in heterokaryotypes and then permit substantial recombination once established, thereby avoiding the deleterious genetic consequences that arise when recombination is completely and permanently halted.",
  "In D. melanogaster and D. simulans, most TE insertions segregate at low frequencies due to recent high activity across many families, with TE insertions sometimes conferring adaptive advantages; recombination rate and population size are major factors modulating the strength of selection against TE insertions.",
  "In Drosophila melanogaster, transposable elements are widespread genomic components that can drive adaptive evolution—often through regulatory impacts on nearby genes—with an estimated rate of one TE-associated adaptation emerging every 200–1,250 years.",
  "The study frames vertebrate whole-genome duplications (polyploidization) as a prominent hypothesis to explain fourfold paralogons in humans and explicitly evaluates this vertebrate polyploidy proposal for the Hsa 1/2/8/20 paralogon.",
  "In polyploid wheat, multiple functional gene copies (homeologs) provide redundancy that buffers genetic change, masks recessive loss-of-function mutations, and allows tolerance to high densities of induced mutations.",
  "The paper demonstrates that selection against deleterious mutations (background selection) can markedly reduce neutral genetic diversity in regions with limited recombination (including highly selfing or asexual contexts), while even very low levels of recombination can substantially diminish this effect.",
  "Transposable elements are abundant mutagenic components of the Drosophila genome that can both drive adaptive evolution and produce large-scale structural changes (including chromosomal inversions), with many fixed insertions observed in low-recombination regions where selection is less effective.",
  "The paper explains that in populations with limited or absent recombination, deleterious mutations accumulate through Muller’s ratchet, whereas recombination can recreate mutation-free genotypes and thus reduces mutational load.",
  "The paper argues that short tandem repeats (STRs) are maintained by selection because they enhance evolvability and can function as genetic modifiers—sometimes compensating for mutations in interacting regulators—consistent with a role for high-mutation-rate tandem repeats in facilitating coadaptation.",
  "In an inbred invasive ant, transposable element ‘islands’ accumulate in low-recombination regions and act as concentrated sources of genetic variation and diversification, supporting adaptation despite constraints imposed by inbreeding and founder effects.",
  "The paper demonstrates that complete genetic linkage can cause mutation rates to escalate to intolerable levels in adapting asexual populations, leading to extinction, and argues that recombination—by breaking linkage—can prevent such runaway increases in mutation rate and may have been favored early in evolution for this protective role.",
  "Structural X-chromosome variants in Turner syndrome commonly involve an isochromosome of the long arm (46X,iso[Xq]); such variants may lack classic Turner features and present with short stature and amenorrhea/infertility.",
  "In Turner syndrome, a common structural variant is an isodicentric X chromosome [idic(X)(p11)], which creates a dicentric X with two q-arms and monosomy for most of Xp; this variant can occur as 46,X,idic(X)(p11) or as a mosaic with 45,X and is associated with short stature and pre-pubertal ovarian failure leading to infertility.",
  "Turner syndrome can arise from structural X-chromosome defects (not only 45,X), with SHOX haploinsufficiency at Xp22.23 explaining short stature, while deletions involving Xq26–Xq28 or Xq13.3–q21.3 are associated with ovarian dysfunction/premature ovarian failure.",
  "Turner syndrome can arise from partial or complete loss of X chromosome material—often involving partial or complete monosomy of Xp due to deletions or i(Xq)—with short stature linked to decreased SHOX expression; low-level mosaicism (<10%) may not be detected by standard karyotyping.",
  "The paper attributes the Turner syndrome phenotype to hemizygosity of genes normally expressed from both active and inactive X chromosomes, with evidence indicating monosomy for the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp) as the underlying cause; clinically, TS includes short stature and gonadal dysgenesis, and a documented donor case presented with primary amenorrhea and short stature.",
  "Gouty tophi may accumulate in carpal tunnel structures (flexor tendons, tendon sheaths, carpal tunnel floor, transverse carpal ligament, or directly on the median nerve), creating a space-occupying effect that compresses the median nerve and produces carpal tunnel syndrome with pain, numbness, and weakness.",
  "An anomalous (accessory) flexor digitorum superficialis muscle belly can occur within the carpal tunnel, increase tunnel contents, and compress/displace the median nerve, representing a rare (~1.3% of CTS cases) anatomic cause of carpal tunnel syndrome.",
  "Gout-related monosodium urate tophi can deposit around the carpal tunnel (intercarpal and radiocarpal joints), compress structures overlying the flexor tendons, and produce carpal tunnel syndrome with median nerve involvement; dual-energy CT can noninvasively demonstrate these deposits.",
  "CTS evaluation should consider both anatomical variants (e.g., rare intratunnel ulnar nerve causing combined median and ulnar symptoms; bifid median nerve associated with an additional division of the superficial flexor of the third finger) and differential diagnoses such as de Quervain tendinopathy (tenderness at the distal radial styloid), pronator syndrome (forearm pain, sensory loss over the thenar eminence, weakness with thumb flexion and wrist extension), and carpometacarpal thumb arthritis (painful thumb movement with positive grind test).",
  "An accessory/anomalous flexor digitorum superficialis muscle belly within the carpal tunnel can increase tunnel contents and compress the median nerve, sometimes presenting with a palpable mass, and is a recognized cause of carpal tunnel syndrome.",
  "CTS is a symptomatic compression of the median nerve at the wrist where the palm is generally spared because the palmar cutaneous branch arises proximal to the transverse carpal ligament, while pronator syndrome involves median nerve compression in the forearm and includes sensory alteration in the palmar cutaneous distribution; space-occupying lesions within the carpal tunnel (e.g., tumor-like masses) can increase tunnel volume and contribute to CTS.",
  "Gouty tophi can deposit within carpal tunnel structures—including flexor tendons, tendon sheaths, the carpal tunnel floor, and even under the median nerve epineurium—producing nontraumatic compression of the median nerve and carpal tunnel syndrome, a rare but recognized cause.",
  "CTS is defined as a peripheral mononeuropathy of the median nerve caused by increased pressure within the carpal tunnel; it can arise from local causes such as cysts and is associated with occupational exposures including repetitive and forceful hand activities and vibration.",
  "Palmaris profundus is a rare accessory muscle-tendon unit that inserts into the flexor retinaculum and palmar aponeurosis, can cause carpal tunnel–like symptoms, and may mimic an intraneural mass on imaging.",
  "Gouty tophi can infiltrate flexor tendons and form masses at the carpal tunnel level that compress the median nerve, producing carpal tunnel syndrome; this mechanism is rare (approximately 0.6% of CTS cases) and can be identified on MRI as a mass within the flexor tendons pressing the median nerve.",
  "In eukaryotic tRNAs that decode two-box codon families (Lys, Glu, Gln), the wobble U34 carries sulfur at C2 and a methyl-derivative at C5, modifications that are required to form the proper anticodon loop and to achieve accurate codon-anticodon pairing and efficient decoding during translation.",
  "Loss of the taurine wobble modification in human mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) causes a specific failure to decode the UUG leucine codon—linked mechanistically to insufficient stabilization of U:G wobble pairing at the ribosomal A-site—while decoding of the UUA codon remains largely unaffected.",
  "Anticodon base substitutions can swap tRNA identities between Trp and Gln, causing a tRNA to be charged by a different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and to insert an amino acid typically specified by another tRNA (e.g., Trp↔Gln), with recognition depending critically on specific anticodon positions.",
  "The 2-thiouridine wobble modification (xm5s2U) at tRNA position 34 enables preferential pairing with purines (A/G) at the third codon position, enhances efficient codon recognition on the ribosome, and reduces misreading of pyrimidine-ending near-cognate codons, thereby influencing translation accuracy and decoding specificity.",
  "The study demonstrates that altering a tRNA’s anticodon can cause it to be charged by a non-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (e.g., Trp tRNA with CUA anticodon charged by LysRS or GlnRS), leading to insertion of an alternative amino acid at the targeted codon and, in some cases, producing low-frequency mixed incorporation consistent with ambiguous decoding.",
  "In split 2:2 codon boxes, tRNAs require U34 modifications to read purine-ending codons, and translational missense errors arising from non-cognate anticodon pairing or mischarging typically occur at low frequencies (~10^-5 to 10^-3), indicating that modified wobble interactions can enable rare but measurable amino acid misincorporations during translation.",
  "In human mitochondrial tRNALeu, the wobble modification τm5U at position 34 enables decoding of both UUG and UUA codons by employing wobble and a novel single hydrogen bond, with a noted preference for G-ending codons.",
  "Engineering tRNA anticodon changes redirected codon recognition while preserving charging by the original amino acid, causing specific mistranslation events (e.g., alanine for tryptophan; glutamate for glutamine; aspartate for asparagine) and generating altered protein variants during translation.",
  "An anticodon-mutated E. coli tRNAGln (opal suppressor with UCA anticodon) is mischarged by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase and predominantly inserts tryptophan during UGA suppression, demonstrating that base substitutions in tRNA anticodons can redirect amino acid identity and alter the resulting protein sequence.",
  "The study shows that aminoacyl-tRNAs can misread near-cognate codons, generating amino acid substitution errors, with pronounced error hot spots for specific mismatches (e.g., U:G in the second codon position) where tRNAs such as Glu-tRNAGlu and His-tRNAHis insert their amino acids at codons normally specifying Gly, Asp, Arg, or Gln.",
  "In mixed codon boxes, wobble U derivatives with xnm5 side chains base pair with A- and G-ending codons; for example, E. coli tRNALeu with anticodon UAA decodes UUA/UUG, while other tRNAs (e.g., tRNAGln with anticodon UUG) decode CAA/CAG, illustrating that altering a tRNA’s anticodon can redirect decoding to codons normally assigned to a different amino acid.",
  "Hypermodified wobble uridine (mnm5s2U34) in E. coli tRNALys enables decoding of both AAA and AAG through distinct base-pairing geometries—including an unusual S34–G wobble interaction—illustrating how tRNA modifications expand genetic code degeneracy; typical cellular mistranslation rates occur at roughly 10−3 to 10−5.",
  "tRNA anticodon identity largely dictates codon recognition, and wobble position-34 uridine modifications (e.g., mcm5s2U/mnm5s2U) prestructure the anticodon loop to enable stable decoding of purine-ending codons (AAA/AAG); such chemistry underlies observed mistranslation events like Lys→Asn in twofold degenerate boxes.",
  "An anticodon mutation converting tRNATrp into an amber suppressor enables decoding of UAG stop codons; in yeast this suppressor tRNA inserts tryptophan at roughly 80% of UAG sites, whereas in E. coli analogous suppressors predominantly insert glutamine."
