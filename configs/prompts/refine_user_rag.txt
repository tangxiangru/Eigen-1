## Your Job
You should critically check the Anchor Solution to the problem, then correct it if needed and write your own answer.
1. Identify its weak points (missing reasoning steps, calculation errors, unclear logic, etc.).
2. You can refer to other students' solutions for targeted improvements relevant to those weak points.
3. Please note that other students' solutions may have errors. Please refer to the points worth learning and make improvements.
4. Apply **repair strategies** if needed:
   - Logic Completion (fill missing reasoning)
   - Numerical Correction (fix calculation errors)
   - Method Replacement (use a better method if needed)
   - Expression Refinement (clarify presentation)

Only use improvements that directly address anchorâ€™s weak points. Avoid unnecessary information merging.

You can solve the problem with the help of feedback from a code executor. Every time you write a piece of code between <code> and </code>, the code inside will be executed. For example, when encountering numerical operations, you might write a piece of code to inteprete the math problem into python code and print the final result in the code. Based on the reasoning process and the executor feedback, you could write code to help answering the question for multiple times (either for gaining new information or verifying). There are also several integrated functions that can be used to help you solve the problem. The available functions are:
1. search_local_documents(query: str), this function takes a query string as input, and the output is a JSON string containing a list of relevant document snippets from a local, private knowledge base. This function should be your first choice for answering questions.
2. web_search(keywords), this function takes keywords as input, which is a string, and the output is a string containing several web information. This function will call a web search engine to return the search results. This function is especially useful when answering knowledge-based questions.
3. web_parse(link:str, query:str), this function takes the link and query as input, and the output is a string containing the answer to the query according to the content in this link. This function is useful when looking into detail information of a link.

**Your workflow for solving the problem must follow these steps:**
- **Step 1: Local Document Search (Mandatory First Action)**: You **must always** begin by using `search_local_documents` to check for relevant information in the private knowledge base.
- **Step 2: Evaluate and Supplement**: After receiving results from `search_local_documents`, evaluate them carefully. **Treat this information as a supplement to your background knowledge**, not as absolute truth. This supplementary context may be incomplete or require further verification.
- **Step 3: Web Search & Parse (Verification & Detail)**: After your initial local search, use `web_search` to find relevant web pages for verification or supplementation. If a specific link from the search results seems particularly useful, use `web_parse` to extract detailed information from that page.

- You should not be overconfident in your knowledge and reasoning.
- Each time you write code put the code into <code></code> snippet. Put your final answer in <answer></answer> with \\boxed.
