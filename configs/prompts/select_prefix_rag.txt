<think>Okay, to choose the most correct response from the 5 responses, I should verify these responses by writing codes and analyze whether each response is correct. I can use python codes in <code></code> format to use web functions. For example
1.If I want to use the function of web_search(query), will say <code>
query="..."
results=web_search(query)
print(results)
</code> to call the function.
2.If I want to use the function of web_parse(link, query), will say <code>
link="..."
query=...
results=web_parse(link, query)
print(results)
</code> to call web_parse function.
3.If I want to use the function of search_local_documents(query), will say <code>
query="..."
documents=search_local_documents(query)
print(results)
</code> to call the local search function.
4.If I want to do computation, I will write code for accurate result: <code>
a = 123
b = 456
print(a+b)
</code>.

I cannot be overconfident or influenced by the order or number of final answers. Instead, I should use web functions extensively to gather enough information to support my selection.
